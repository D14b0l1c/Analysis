# data/

This directory contains all data files used and generated by the VTK pipeline.

It is structured to keep input sources, analysis outputs, and vulnerability database artifacts separated for clarity and reproducibility.

## Folder Structure

```
data/
├── input/       # Raw input files for analysis (.pcap, .xml)
├── output/      # Extracted fields and vulnerability match results
└── db/          # Intermediate flattened/merged NVD + ExploitDB data
```

## `input/` — Analysis Inputs

Drop any of the following here:

- `*.pcap`: Network packet captures
- `*.xml`: Nmap scan results (in XML format)

### Examples:
- `vulnerable_traffic.pcap`
- `sample-nmap-output.xml`
- `nmap_example.xml`

These are read by `main.py` depending on file extension.

## `output/` — Generated Results

This folder contains the output from data extraction and vulnerability matching.

### Output files:

| File                          | Description                                |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `pcap_extracted_output.csv`   | Extracted metadata from `.pcap` file       |
| `pcap_matches.csv`            | Matched CVEs from extracted `.pcap` data   |
| `nmap_extracted_output.csv`   | Extracted services from `.xml` scan        |
| `nmap_matches.csv`            | Matched CVEs from `.xml` Nmap service data |

Each file is overwritten on each run — organize or rename as needed.
