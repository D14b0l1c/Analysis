CVE-2025-0343,"Swift ASN.1 can be caused to crash when parsing certain BER/DER constructions. This crash is caused by a confusion in the ASN.1 library itself which assumes that certain objects can only be provided in either constructed or primitive forms, and will trigger a preconditionFailure if that constraint isn't met.

Importantly, these constraints are actually required to be true in DER, but that correctness wasn't enforced on the early node parser side so it was incorrect to rely on it later on in decoding, which is what the library did.

These crashes can be triggered when parsing any DER/BER format object. There is no memory-safety issue here: the crash is a graceful one from the Swift runtime. The impact of this is that it can be used as a denial-of-service vector when parsing BER/DER data from unknown sources, e.g. when parsing TLS certificates.",,,

net: reenable NETIF_F_IPV6_CSUM offload for BIG TCP packets

The blamed commit disabled hardware offoad of IPv6 packets with
extension headers on devices that advertise NETIF_F_IPV6_CSUM,
based on the definition of that feature in skbuff.h:

 *   * - %NETIF_F_IPV6_CSUM
 *     - Driver (device) is only able to checksum plain
 *       TCP or UDP packets over IPv6. These are specifically
 *       unencapsulated packets of the form IPv6|TCP or
 *       IPv6|UDP where the Next Header field in the IPv6
 *       header is either TCP or UDP. IPv6 extension headers
 *       are not supported with this feature. This feature
 *       cannot be set in features for a device with
 *       NETIF_F_HW_CSUM also set. This feature is being
 *       DEPRECATED (see below).

The change causes skb_warn_bad_offload to fire for BIG TCP
packets.

CVE-2025-21632,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/fpu: Ensure shadow stack is active before ""getting"" registers

The x86 shadow stack support has its own set of registers. Those registers
are XSAVE-managed, but they are ""supervisor state components"" which means
that userspace can not touch them with XSAVE/XRSTOR.  It also means that
they are not accessible from the existing ptrace ABI for XSAVE state.
Thus, there is a new ptrace get/set interface for it.

The regset code that ptrace uses provides an ->active() handler in
addition to the get/set ones. For shadow stack this ->active() handler
verifies that shadow stack is enabled via the ARCH_SHSTK_SHSTK bit in the
thread struct. The ->active() handler is checked from some call sites of
the regset get/set handlers, but not the ptrace ones. This was not
understood when shadow stack support was put in place.

As a result, both the set/get handlers can be called with
XFEATURE_CET_USER in its init state, which would cause get_xsave_addr() to
return NULL and trigger a WARN_ON(). The ssp_set() handler luckily has an
ssp_active() check to avoid surprising the kernel with shadow stack
behavior when the kernel is not ready for it (ARCH_SHSTK_SHSTK==0). That
check just happened to avoid the warning.

But the ->get() side wasn't so lucky. It can be called with shadow stacks
disabled, triggering the warning in practice, as reported by Christina
Schimpe:

Ensure that shadow stacks are active in a thread before looking them up
in the XSAVE buffer. Since ARCH_SHSTK_SHSTK and user_ssp[SHSTK_EN] are
set at the same time, the active check ensures that there will be
something to find in the XSAVE buffer.

This warning is caused by 'kernfs_break_active_protection' when it is
writing to cpuset.cpus, and the cgroup is removed concurrently.

The commit 3a5a6d0c2b03 (""cpuset: don't nest cgroup_mutex inside
get_online_cpus()"") made cpuset_hotplug_workfn asynchronous, This change
involves calling flush_work(), which can create a multiple processes
circular locking dependency that involve cgroup_mutex, potentially leading
to a deadlock. To avoid deadlock. the commit 76bb5ab8f6e3 (""cpuset: break
kernfs active protection in cpuset_write_resmask()"") added
'kernfs_break_active_protection' in the cpuset_write_resmask. This could
lead to this warning.

After the commit 2125c0034c5d (""cgroup/cpuset: Make cpuset hotplug
processing synchronous""), the cpuset_write_resmask no longer needs to
wait the hotplug to finish, which means that concurrent hotplug and cpuset
operations are no longer possible. Therefore, the deadlock doesn't exist
anymore and it does not have to 'break active protection' now. To fix this
warning, just remove kernfs_break_active_protection operation in the
'cpuset_write_resmask'.",,5.5,CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

mptcp: sysctl: sched: avoid using current->nsproxy

Using the 'net' structure via 'current' is not recommended for different
reasons.

First, if the goal is to use it to read or write per-netns data, this is
inconsistent with how the ""generic"" sysctl entries are doing: directly
by only using pointers set to the table entry, e.g. table->data. Linked
to that, the per-netns data should always be obtained from the table
linked to the netns it had been created for, which may not coincide with
the reader's or writer's netns.

Another reason is that access to current->nsproxy->netns can oops if
attempted when current->nsproxy had been dropped when the current task
is exiting. This is what syzbot found, when using acct(2):

CVE-2025-21643,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfs: Fix kernel async DIO

Netfslib needs to be able to handle kernel-initiated asynchronous DIO that
is supplied with a bio_vec[] array.  Currently, because of the async flag,
this gets passed to netfs_extract_user_iter() which throws a warning and
fails because it only handles IOVEC and UBUF iterators.  This can be
triggered through a combination of cifs and a loopback blockdev with
something like:

        mount //my/cifs/share /foo
        dd if=/dev/zero of=/foo/m0 bs=4K count=1K
        losetup --sector-size 4096 --direct-io=on /dev/loop2046 /foo/m0
        echo hello >/dev/loop2046

This causes the following to appear in syslog:

        WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 109 at fs/netfs/iterator.c:50 netfs_extract_user_iter+0x170/0x250 [netfs]

and the write to fail.

Fix this by removing the check in netfs_unbuffered_write_iter_locked() that
causes async kernel DIO writes to be handled as userspace writes.  Note
that this change relies on the kernel caller maintaining the existence of
the bio_vec array (or kvec[] or folio_queue) until the op is complete.",,,

drm/xe: Fix tlb invalidation when wedging

If GuC fails to load, the driver wedges, but in the process it tries to
do stuff that may not be initialized yet. This moves the
xe_gt_tlb_invalidation_init() to be done earlier: as its own doc says,
it's a software-only initialization and should had been named with the
_early() suffix.

Move it to be called by xe_gt_init_early(), so the locks and seqno are
initialized, avoiding a NULL ptr deref when wedging:

platform/x86/amd/pmc: Only disable IRQ1 wakeup where i8042 actually enabled it

Wakeup for IRQ1 should be disabled only in cases where i8042 had

drop below zero and there will be an unpleasant WARN() logged:

kernel: atkbd serio0: Disabling IRQ1 wakeup source to avoid platform firmware bug

kernel: Unbalanced IRQ 1 wake disable
kernel: WARNING: CPU: 10 PID: 6431 at kernel/irq/manage.c:920 irq_set_irq_wake+0x147/0x1a0

The PMC driver uses DEFINE_SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS() to define its dev_pm_ops
which sets amd_pmc_suspend_handler() to the .suspend, .freeze, and
.poweroff handlers. i8042_pm_suspend(), however, is only set as
the .suspend handler.

Fix the issue by call PMC suspend handler only from the same set of
dev_pm_ops handlers as i8042_pm_suspend(), which currently means just
the .suspend handler.

To reproduce this issue try hibernating (S4) the machine after a fresh boot
without putting it into s2idle first.

CVE-2025-21646,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

afs: Fix the maximum cell name length

The kafs filesystem limits the maximum length of a cell to 256 bytes, but a
problem occurs if someone actually does that: kafs tries to create a
directory under /proc/net/afs/ with the name of the cell, but that fails
with a warning:

        WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 9 at fs/proc/generic.c:405

because procfs limits the maximum filename length to 255.

However, the DNS limits the maximum lookup length and, by extension, the
maximum cell name, to 255 less two (length count and trailing NUL).

Fix this by limiting the maximum acceptable cellname length to 253.  This
also allows us to be sure we can create the ""/afs/.<cell>/"" mountpoint too.

Further, split the YFS VL record cell name maximum to be the 256 allowed by
the protocol and ignore the record retrieved by YFSVL.GetCellName if it
exceeds 253.",,,

sched: sch_cake: add bounds checks to host bulk flow fairness counts

Even though we fixed a logic error in the commit cited below, syzbot
still managed to trigger an underflow of the per-host bulk flow
counters, leading to an out of bounds memory access.

To avoid any such logic errors causing out of bounds memory accesses,
this commit factors out all accesses to the per-host bulk flow counters
to a series of helpers that perform bounds-checking before any
increments and decrements. This also has the benefit of improving
readability by moving the conditional checks for the flow mode into
these helpers, instead of having them spread out throughout the
code (which was the cause of the original logic error).

As part of this change, the flow quantum calculation is consolidated
into a helper function, which means that the dithering applied to the
ost load scaling is now applied both in the DRR rotation and when a
sparse flow's quantum is first initiated. The only user-visible effect
of this is that the maximum packet size that can be sent while a flow
stays sparse will now vary with +/- one byte in some cases. This should
not make a noticeable difference in practice, and thus it's not worth
complicating the code to preserve the old behaviour.",,,

The TQP BAR space is divided into two segments. TQPs 0-1023 and TQPs
1024-1279 are in different BAR space addresses. However,
hclge_fetch_pf_reg does not distinguish the tqp space information when
reading the tqp space information. When the number of TQPs is greater
than 1024, access bar space overwriting occurs.
The problem of different segments has been considered during the
initialization of tqp.io_base. Therefore, tqp.io_base is directly used
when the queue is read in hclge_fetch_pf_reg.

ipvlan: Fix use-after-free in ipvlan_get_iflink().

syzbot presented an use-after-free report [0] regarding ipvlan and
linkwatch.

ipvlan does not hold a refcnt of the lower device unlike vlan and
macvlan.

If the linkwatch work is triggered for the ipvlan dev, the lower dev
might have already been freed, resulting in UAF of ipvlan->phy_dev in
ipvlan_get_iflink().

We can delay the lower dev unregistration like vlan and macvlan by
holding the lower dev's refcnt in dev->netdev_ops->ndo_init() and
releasing it in dev->priv_destructor().

Jakub pointed out calling .ndo_XXX after unregister_netdevice() has
returned is error prone and suggested [1] addressing this UAF in the
core by taking commit 750e51603395 (""net: avoid potential UAF in
default_operstate()"") further.

Let's assume unregistering devices DOWN and use RCU protection in
default_operstate() not to race with the device unregistration.

CVE-2025-21654,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ovl: support encoding fid from inode with no alias

Dmitry Safonov reported that a WARN_ON() assertion can be trigered by
userspace when calling inotify_show_fdinfo() for an overlayfs watched
inode, whose dentry aliases were discarded with drop_caches.

The WARN_ON() assertion in inotify_show_fdinfo() was removed, because
it is possible for encoding file handle to fail for other reason, but
the impact of failing to encode an overlayfs file handle goes beyond
this assertion.

As shown in the LTP test case mentioned in the link below, failure to
encode an overlayfs file handle from a non-aliased inode also leads to
failure to report an fid with FAN_DELETE_SELF fanotify events.

As Dmitry notes in his analyzis of the problem, ovl_encode_fh() fails
if it cannot find an alias for the inode, but this failure can be fixed.
ovl_encode_fh() seldom uses the alias and in the case of non-decodable
file handles, as is often the case with fanotify fid info,
ovl_encode_fh() never needs to use the alias to encode a file handle.

Defer finding an alias until it is actually needed so ovl_encode_fh()
will not fail in the common case of FAN_DELETE_SELF fanotify events.",,,

[CAUSE]
The reproducer is using a corrupted image where extent tree root is
corrupted, thus forcing to use ""rescue=all,ro"" mount option to mount the
image.

Then it triggered a scrub, but since scrub relies on extent tree to find
where the data/metadata extents are, scrub_find_fill_first_stripe()
relies on an non-empty extent root.

But unfortunately scrub_find_fill_first_stripe() doesn't really expect
an NULL pointer for extent root, it use extent_root to grab fs_info and
triggered a NULL pointer dereference.

[FIX]
Add an extra check for a valid extent root at the beginning of
scrub_find_fill_first_stripe().

The new error path is introduced by 42437a6386ff (""btrfs: introduce
mount option rescue=ignorebadroots""), but that's pretty old, and later
commit b979547513ff (""btrfs: scrub: introduce helper to find and fill
sector info for a scrub_stripe"") changed how we do scrub.

CVE-2025-21664,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm thin: make get_first_thin use rcu-safe list first function

The documentation in rculist.h explains the absence of list_empty_rcu()
and cautions programmers against relying on a list_empty() ->
list_first() sequence in RCU safe code.  This is because each of these
functions performs its own READ_ONCE() of the list head.  This can lead
to a situation where the list_empty() sees a valid list entry, but the
subsequent list_first() sees a different view of list head state after a
modification.

In the case of dm-thin, this author had a production box crash from a GP
fault in the process_deferred_bios path.  This function saw a valid list
head in get_first_thin() but when it subsequently dereferenced that and
turned it into a thin_c, it got the inside of the struct pool, since the
list was now empty and referring to itself.  The kernel on which this
occurred printed both a warning about a refcount_t being saturated, and
a UBSAN error for an out-of-bounds cpuid access in the queued spinlock,
prior to the fault itself.  When the resulting kdump was examined, it
was possible to see another thread patiently waiting in thin_dtr's
synchronize_rcu.

The thin_dtr call managed to pull the thin_c out of the active thins
list (and have it be the last entry in the active_thins list) at just
the wrong moment which lead to this crash.

Fortunately, the fix here is straight forward.  Switch get_first_thin()
function to use list_first_or_null_rcu() which performs just a single
READ_ONCE() and returns NULL if the list is already empty.

This was run against the devicemapper test suite's thin-provisioning
suites for delete and suspend and no regressions were observed.",,,

below lag definers get double-destroyed and cause kernel crash:

CVE-2025-21676,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: fec: handle page_pool_dev_alloc_pages error

The fec_enet_update_cbd function calls page_pool_dev_alloc_pages but did
not handle the case when it returned NULL. There was a WARN_ON(!new_page)
but it would still proceed to use the NULL pointer and then crash.

This case does seem somewhat rare but when the system is under memory
pressure it can happen. One case where I can duplicate this with some
frequency is when writing over a smbd share to a SATA HDD attached to an
imx6q.

Setting /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes to higher values also seems to solve
the problem for my test case. But it still seems wrong that the fec driver
ignores the memory allocation error and can crash.

This commit handles the allocation error by dropping the current packet.",,5.5,CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
CVE-2025-21677,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pfcp: Destroy device along with udp socket's netns dismantle.

pfcp_newlink() links the device to a list in dev_net(dev) instead
of net, where a udp tunnel socket is created.

Even when net is removed, the device stays alive on dev_net(dev).
Then, removing net triggers the splat below. [0]

In this example, pfcp0 is created in ns2, but the udp socket is
created in ns1.

  ip netns add ns1
  ip netns add ns2
  ip -n ns1 link add netns ns2 name pfcp0 type pfcp
  ip netns del ns1

Let's link the device to the socket's netns instead.

Now, pfcp_net_exit() needs another netdev iteration to remove
all pfcp devices in the netns.

pfcp_dev_list is not used under RCU, so the list API is converted
to the non-RCU variant.

pfcp_net_exit() can be converted to .exit_batch_rtnl() in net-next.

CVE-2025-21681,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

openvswitch: fix lockup on tx to unregistering netdev with carrier

Commit in a fixes tag attempted to fix the issue in the following
sequence of calls:

    do_output
    -> ovs_vport_send
       -> dev_queue_xmit
          -> __dev_queue_xmit
             -> netdev_core_pick_tx
                -> skb_tx_hash

When device is unregistering, the 'dev->real_num_tx_queues' goes to
zero and the 'while (unlikely(hash >= qcount))' loop inside the
'skb_tx_hash' becomes infinite, locking up the core forever.

But unfortunately, checking just the carrier status is not enough to
fix the issue, because some devices may still be in unregistering
state while reporting carrier status OK.

One example of such device is a net/dummy.  It sets carrier ON
on start, but it doesn't implement .ndo_stop to set the carrier off.
And it makes sense, because dummy doesn't really have a carrier.
Therefore, while this device is unregistering, it's still easy to hit
the infinite loop in the skb_tx_hash() from the OVS datapath.  There
might be other drivers that do the same, but dummy by itself is
important for the OVS ecosystem, because it is frequently used as a
packet sink for tcpdump while debugging OVS deployments.  And when the
issue is hit, the only way to recover is to reboot.

Fix that by also checking if the device is running.  The running
state is handled by the net core during unregistering, so it covers
unregistering case better, and we don't really need to send packets
to devices that are not running anyway.

While only checking the running state might be enough, the carrier
check is preserved.  The running and the carrier states seem disjoined
throughout the code and different drivers.  And other core functions
like __dev_direct_xmit() check both before attempting to transmit
a packet.  So, it seems safer to check both flags in OVS as well.",,5.5,CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
CVE-2025-21682,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

eth: bnxt: always recalculate features after XDP clearing, fix null-deref

Recalculate features when XDP is detached.

Before:
  # ip li set dev eth0 xdp obj xdp_dummy.bpf.o sec xdp
  # ip li set dev eth0 xdp off
  # ethtool -k eth0 | grep gro
  rx-gro-hw: off [requested on]

After:
  # ip li set dev eth0 xdp obj xdp_dummy.bpf.o sec xdp
  # ip li set dev eth0 xdp off
  # ethtool -k eth0 | grep gro
  rx-gro-hw: on

The fact that HW-GRO doesn't get re-enabled automatically is just
a minor annoyance. The real issue is that the features will randomly
come back during another reconfiguration which just happens to invoke
netdev_update_features(). The driver doesn't handle reconfiguring
two things at a time very robustly.

Starting with commit 98ba1d931f61 (""bnxt_en: Fix RSS logic in
__bnxt_reserve_rings()"") we only reconfigure the RSS hash table
if the ""effective"" number of Rx rings has changed. If HW-GRO is
enabled ""effective"" number of rings is 2x what user sees.
So if we are in the bad state, with HW-GRO re-enablement ""pending""
after XDP off, and we lower the rings by / 2 - the HW-GRO rings
doing 2x and the ethtool -L doing / 2 may cancel each other out,
and the:

  if (old_rx_rings != bp->hw_resc.resv_rx_rings &&

condition in __bnxt_reserve_rings() will be false.
The RSS map won't get updated, and we'll crash with:

  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000168

CVE-2025-21688,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/v3d: Assign job pointer to NULL before signaling the fence

In commit e4b5ccd392b9 (""drm/v3d: Ensure job pointer is set to NULL
after job completion""), we introduced a change to assign the job pointer
to NULL after completing a job, indicating job completion.

However, this approach created a race condition between the DRM
scheduler workqueue and the IRQ execution thread. As soon as the fence is
signaled in the IRQ execution thread, a new job starts to be executed.
This results in a race condition where the IRQ execution thread sets the
job pointer to NULL simultaneously as the `run_job()` function assigns
a new job to the pointer.

This race condition can lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the IRQ
execution thread sets the job pointer to NULL after `run_job()` assigns
it to the new job. When the new job completes and the GPU emits an
interrupt, `v3d_irq()` is triggered, potentially causing a crash.

CVE-2025-21693,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: zswap: properly synchronize freeing resources during CPU hotunplug

In zswap_compress() and zswap_decompress(), the per-CPU acomp_ctx of the
current CPU at the beginning of the operation is retrieved and used
throughout.  However, since neither preemption nor migration are disabled,
it is possible that the operation continues on a different CPU.

If the original CPU is hotunplugged while the acomp_ctx is still in use,
we run into a UAF bug as some of the resources attached to the acomp_ctx
are freed during hotunplug in zswap_cpu_comp_dead() (i.e. 
acomp_ctx.buffer, acomp_ctx.req, or acomp_ctx.acomp).

The problem was introduced in commit 1ec3b5fe6eec (""mm/zswap: move to use
crypto_acomp API for hardware acceleration"") when the switch to the
crypto_acomp API was made.  Prior to that, the per-CPU crypto_comp was
retrieved using get_cpu_ptr() which disables preemption and makes sure the
CPU cannot go away from under us.  Preemption cannot be disabled with the
crypto_acomp API as a sleepable context is needed.

Use the acomp_ctx.mutex to synchronize CPU hotplug callbacks allocating
and freeing resources with compression/decompression paths.  Make sure
that acomp_ctx.req is NULL when the resources are freed.  In the
compression/decompression paths, check if acomp_ctx.req is NULL after
acquiring the mutex (meaning the CPU was offlined) and retry on the new
CPU.

The initialization of acomp_ctx.mutex is moved from the CPU hotplug
callback to the pool initialization where it belongs (where the mutex is
allocated).  In addition to adding clarity, this makes sure that CPU
hotplug cannot reinitialize a mutex that is already locked by
compression/decompression.

Previously a fix was attempted by holding cpus_read_lock() [1].  This
would have caused a potential deadlock as it is possible for code already
holding the lock to fall into reclaim and enter zswap (causing a
deadlock).  A fix was also attempted using SRCU for synchronization, but
Johannes pointed out that synchronize_srcu() cannot be used in CPU hotplug
notifiers [2].

Alternative fixes that were considered/attempted and could have worked:
- Refcounting the per-CPU acomp_ctx. This involves complexity in
  handling the race between the refcount dropping to zero in
  zswap_[de]compress() and the refcount being re-initialized when the
  CPU is onlined.
- Disabling migration before getting the per-CPU acomp_ctx [3], but
  that's discouraged and is a much bigger hammer than needed, and could
  result in subtle performance issues.

fs/proc: fix softlockup in __read_vmcore (part 2)

Since commit 5cbcb62dddf5 (""fs/proc: fix softlockup in __read_vmcore"") the
number of softlockups in __read_vmcore at kdump time have gone down, but
they still happen sometimes.

In a memory constrained environment like the kdump image, a softlockup is
not just a harmless message, but it can interfere with things like RCU
freeing memory, causing the crashdump to get stuck.

The second loop in __read_vmcore has a lot more opportunities for natural

happen, but apparently that is not always enough.

platform/x86: dell-uart-backlight: fix serdev race

The dell_uart_bl_serdev_probe() function calls devm_serdev_device_open()

devm_serdev_device_open() was called before fully initializing the

mm: clear uffd-wp PTE/PMD state on mremap()

When mremap()ing a memory region previously registered with userfaultfd as

Fix this by always explicitly clearing the uffd-wp pte/pmd flags on any

net: sched: Disallow replacing of child qdisc from one parent to another

Lion Ackermann was able to create a UAF which can be abused for privilege
escalation with the following script

Step 1. create root qdisc
tc qdisc add dev lo root handle 1:0 drr

step2. a class for packet aggregation do demonstrate uaf
tc class add dev lo classid 1:1 drr

step3. a class for nesting
tc class add dev lo classid 1:2 drr

step4. a class to graft qdisc to
tc class add dev lo classid 1:3 drr

step5.
tc qdisc add dev lo parent 1:1 handle 2:0 plug limit 1024

step6.
tc qdisc add dev lo parent 1:2 handle 3:0 drr

step7.
tc class add dev lo classid 3:1 drr

step 8.
tc qdisc add dev lo parent 3:1 handle 4:0 pfifo

step 9. Display the class/qdisc layout

tc class ls dev lo
 class drr 1:1 root leaf 2: quantum 64Kb
 class drr 1:2 root leaf 3: quantum 64Kb
 class drr 3:1 root leaf 4: quantum 64Kb

tc qdisc ls
 qdisc drr 1: dev lo root refcnt 2
 qdisc plug 2: dev lo parent 1:1
 qdisc pfifo 4: dev lo parent 3:1 limit 1000p
 qdisc drr 3: dev lo parent 1:2

step10. trigger the bug <=== prevented by this patch
tc qdisc replace dev lo parent 1:3 handle 4:0

step 11. Redisplay again the qdiscs/classes

tc class ls dev lo
 class drr 1:1 root leaf 2: quantum 64Kb
 class drr 1:2 root leaf 3: quantum 64Kb
 class drr 1:3 root leaf 4: quantum 64Kb
 class drr 3:1 root leaf 4: quantum 64Kb

tc qdisc ls
 qdisc drr 1: dev lo root refcnt 2
 qdisc plug 2: dev lo parent 1:1
 qdisc pfifo 4: dev lo parent 3:1 refcnt 2 limit 1000p
 qdisc drr 3: dev lo parent 1:2

Observe that a) parent for 4:0 does not change despite the replace request.
There can only be one parent.  b) refcount has gone up by two for 4:0 and
c) both class 1:3 and 3:1 are pointing to it.

Step 12.  send one packet to plug
echo """" | socat -u STDIN UDP4-DATAGRAM:127.0.0.1:8888,priority=$((0x10001))
step13.  send one packet to the grafted fifo
echo """" | socat -u STDIN UDP4-DATAGRAM:127.0.0.1:8888,priority=$((0x10003))

step14. lets trigger the uaf
tc class delete dev lo classid 1:3
tc class delete dev lo classid 1:1

The semantics of ""replace"" is for a del/add _on the same node_ and not
a delete from one node(3:1) and add to another node (1:3) as in step10.
While we could ""fix"" with a more complex approach there could be
consequences to expectations so the patch takes the preventive approach of
""disallow such config"".

This is because unregister_netdevice_many_notify might run before the
rtnl lock section of ethnl operations, eg. set_channels in the above
example. In this example the rss lock would be destroyed by the device
unregistration path before being used again, but in general running
ethnl operations while dismantle has started is not a good idea.

Fix this by denying any operation on devices being unregistered. A check
was already there in ethnl_ops_begin, but not wide enough.

Note that the same issue cannot be seen on the ioctl version
(__dev_ethtool) because the device reference is retrieved from within
the rtnl lock section there. Once dismantle started, the net device is
unlisted and no reference will be found.",,,
CVE-2025-21702,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pfifo_tail_enqueue: Drop new packet when sch->limit == 0

Expected behaviour:
In case we reach scheduler's limit, pfifo_tail_enqueue() will drop a
packet in scheduler's queue and decrease scheduler's qlen by one.
Then, pfifo_tail_enqueue() enqueue new packet and increase
scheduler's qlen by one. Finally, pfifo_tail_enqueue() return
`NET_XMIT_CN` status code.

Weird behaviour:
In case we set `sch->limit == 0` and trigger pfifo_tail_enqueue() on a
scheduler that has no packet, the 'drop a packet' step will do nothing.
This means the scheduler's qlen still has value equal 0.
Then, we continue to enqueue new packet and increase scheduler's qlen by
one. In summary, we can leverage pfifo_tail_enqueue() to increase qlen by
one and return `NET_XMIT_CN` status code.

The problem is:
Let's say we have two qdiscs: Qdisc_A and Qdisc_B.
 - Qdisc_A's type must have '->graft()' function to create parent/child relationship.
   Let's say Qdisc_A's type is `hfsc`. Enqueue packet to this qdisc will trigger `hfsc_enqueue`.
 - Qdisc_B's type is pfifo_head_drop. Enqueue packet to this qdisc will trigger `pfifo_tail_enqueue`.
 - Qdisc_B is configured to have `sch->limit == 0`.
 - Qdisc_A is configured to route the enqueued's packet to Qdisc_B.

Enqueue packet through Qdisc_A will lead to:
 - hfsc_enqueue(Qdisc_A) -> pfifo_tail_enqueue(Qdisc_B)
 - Qdisc_B->q.qlen += 1
 - pfifo_tail_enqueue() return `NET_XMIT_CN`
 - hfsc_enqueue() check for `NET_XMIT_SUCCESS` and see `NET_XMIT_CN` => hfsc_enqueue() don't increase qlen of Qdisc_A.

The whole process lead to a situation where Qdisc_A->q.qlen == 0 and Qdisc_B->q.qlen == 1.
Replace 'hfsc' with other type (for example: 'drr') still lead to the same problem.
This violate the design where parent's qlen should equal to the sum of its childrens'qlen.

properly error out.",,,
CVE-2025-21706,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mptcp: pm: only set fullmesh for subflow endp

With the in-kernel path-manager, it is possible to change the 'fullmesh'
flag. The code in mptcp_pm_nl_fullmesh() expects to change it only on
'subflow' endpoints, to recreate more or less subflows using the linked
address.

Unfortunately, the set_flags() hook was a bit more permissive, and
allowed 'implicit' endpoints to get the 'fullmesh' flag while it is not
allowed before.

That's what syzbot found, triggering the following warning:

CVE-2025-21709,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

kernel: be more careful about dup_mmap() failures and uprobe registering

If a memory allocation fails during dup_mmap(), the maple tree can be left
in an unsafe state for other iterators besides the exit path.  All the
locks are dropped before the exit_mmap() call (in mm/mmap.c), but the
incomplete mm_struct can be reached through (at least) the rmap finding
the vmas which have a pointer back to the mm_struct.

Up to this point, there have been no issues with being able to find an
mm_struct that was only partially initialised.  Syzbot was able to make
the incomplete mm_struct fail with recent forking changes, so it has been
proven unsafe to use the mm_struct that hasn't been initialised, as
referenced in the link below.

Although 8ac662f5da19f (""fork: avoid inappropriate uprobe access to
invalid mm"") fixed the uprobe access, it does not completely remove the
race.

This patch sets the MMF_OOM_SKIP to avoid the iteration of the vmas on the
oom side (even though this is extremely unlikely to be selected as an oom
victim in the race window), and sets MMF_UNSTABLE to avoid other potential
users from using a partially initialised mm_struct.

When registering vmas for uprobe, skip the vmas in an mm that is marked
unstable.  Modifying a vma in an unstable mm may cause issues if the mm
isn't fully initialised.",,,
CVE-2025-21710,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tcp: correct handling of extreme memory squeeze

Testing with iperf3 using the ""pasta"" protocol splicer has revealed
a problem in the way tcp handles window advertising in extreme memory
squeeze situations.

Under memory pressure, a socket endpoint may temporarily advertise
a zero-sized window, but this is not stored as part of the socket data.
The reasoning behind this is that it is considered a temporary setting
which shouldn't influence any further calculations.

However, if we happen to stall at an unfortunate value of the current
window size, the algorithm selecting a new value will consistently fail
to advertise a non-zero window once we have freed up enough memory.
This means that this side's notion of the current window size is
different from the one last advertised to the peer, causing the latter
to not send any data to resolve the sitution.

The problem occurs on the iperf3 server side, and the socket in question
is a completely regular socket with the default settings for the
fedora40 kernel. We do not use SO_PEEK or SO_RCVBUF on the socket.

CVE-2025-21721,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: handle errors that nilfs_prepare_chunk() may return

Patch series ""nilfs2: fix issues with rename operations"".

This series fixes BUG_ON check failures reported by syzbot around rename
operations, and a minor behavioral issue where the mtime of a child
directory changes when it is renamed instead of moved.


This patch (of 2):

The directory manipulation routines nilfs_set_link() and
nilfs_delete_entry() rewrite the directory entry in the folio/page
previously read by nilfs_find_entry(), so error handling is omitted on the
assumption that nilfs_prepare_chunk(), which prepares the buffer for
rewriting, will always succeed for these.  And if an error is returned, it
triggers the legacy BUG_ON() checks in each routine.

This assumption is wrong, as proven by syzbot: the buffer layer called by
nilfs_prepare_chunk() may call nilfs_get_block() if necessary, which may
fail due to metadata corruption or other reasons.  This has been there all
along, but improved sanity checks and error handling may have made it more
reproducible in fuzzing tests.

Fix this issue by adding missing error paths in nilfs_set_link(),
nilfs_delete_entry(), and their caller nilfs_rename().",,,

This series fixes the buffer head state inconsistency issues reported by

This patch (of 2):

Syzbot has reported that after nilfs2 detects filesystem corruption and
falls back to read-only, inconsistencies in the buffer state may occur.

One of the inconsistencies is that when nilfs2 calls mark_buffer_dirty()
to set a data or metadata buffer as dirty, but it detects that the buffer
is not in the uptodate state:

padata: fix UAF in padata_reorder

A bug was found when run ltp test:

BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in padata_find_next+0x29/0x1a0

If 'mdelay(10)' is added before calling 'padata_find_next' in the
'padata_reorder' function, this issue could be reproduced easily with
ltp test (pcrypt_aead01).

This can be explained as bellow:

pcrypt_aead_encrypt
...
padata_do_parallel
refcount_inc(&pd->refcnt); // add refcnt
...
padata_do_serial
padata_reorder // pd
while (1) {
padata_find_next(pd, true); // using pd
queue_work_on
...
padata_serial_worker				crypto_del_alg
padata_put_pd_cnt // sub refcnt
						padata_free_shell
						padata_put_pd(ps->pd);
						// pd is freed
// loop again, but pd is freed
// call padata_find_next, UAF
}

In the padata_reorder function, when it loops in 'while', if the alg is
deleted, the refcnt may be decreased to 0 before entering
'padata_find_next', which leads to UAF.

As mentioned in [1], do_serial is supposed to be called with BHs disabled
and always happen under RCU protection, to address this issue, add
synchronize_rcu() in 'padata_free_shell' wait for all _do_serial calls
to finish.

RDMA/mlx5: Fix a race for an ODP MR which leads to CQE with error

This patch addresses a race condition for an ODP MR that can result in a
CQE with an error on the UMR QP.

During the __mlx5_ib_dereg_mr() flow, the following sequence of calls
occurs:

mlx5_revoke_mr()
 mlx5r_umr_revoke_mr()
 mlx5r_umr_post_send_wait()

At this point, the lkey is freed from the hardware's perspective.

However, concurrently, mlx5_ib_invalidate_range() might be triggered by
another task attempting to invalidate a range for the same freed lkey.

This task will:
 - Acquire the umem_odp->umem_mutex lock.
 - Call mlx5r_umr_update_xlt() on the UMR QP.
 - Since the lkey has already been freed, this can lead to a CQE error,
   causing the UMR QP to enter an error state [1].

To resolve this race condition, the umem_odp->umem_mutex lock is now also
acquired as part of the mlx5_revoke_mr() scope.  Upon successful revoke,
we set umem_odp->private which points to that MR to NULL, preventing any
further invalidation attempts on its lkey.

ceph: fix memory leak in ceph_mds_auth_match()

We now free the temporary target path substring allocation on every

reveliofuzzing reported that a SCSI_IOCTL_SEND_COMMAND ioctl with out_len

ATA_NOP, and protocol set to ATA_PROT_PIO, can cause ata_pio_sector() to
write outside the allocated buffer, overwriting random memory.

While a ATA device is supposed to abort a ATA_NOP command, there does seem
to be a bug either in libata-sff or QEMU, where either this status is not
set, or the status is cleared before read by ata_sff_hsm_move().
Anyway, that is most likely a separate bug.

Looking at __atapi_pio_bytes(), it already has a safety check to ensure
that __atapi_pio_bytes() cannot write outside the allocated buffer.

Add a similar check to ata_pio_sector(), such that also ata_pio_sector()
cannot write outside the allocated buffer.",,,
CVE-2025-21739,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: ufs: core: Fix use-after free in init error and remove paths

devm_blk_crypto_profile_init() registers a cleanup handler to run when
the associated (platform-) device is being released. For UFS, the
crypto private data and pointers are stored as part of the ufs_hba's
data structure 'struct ufs_hba::crypto_profile'. This structure is
allocated as part of the underlying ufshcd and therefore Scsi_host
allocation.

During driver release or during error handling in ufshcd_pltfrm_init(),
this structure is released as part of ufshcd_dealloc_host() before the
(platform-) device associated with the crypto call above is released.
Once this device is released, the crypto cleanup code will run, using
the just-released 'struct ufs_hba::crypto_profile'. This causes a
use-after-free situation:

      ufshcd_alloc_host()
        scsi_host_alloc()
          allocation of struct ufs_hba
          creation of scsi-host devices
    devm_blk_crypto_profile_init()
      devm registration of cleanup handler using platform-device

and during error handling of ufshcd_pltfrm_init() or during driver
removal:

  ufshcd_dealloc_host()
    scsi_host_put()
      put_device(scsi-host)
        release of struct ufs_hba
  put_device(platform-device)
    crypto cleanup handler

To fix this use-after free, change ufshcd_alloc_host() to register a
devres action to automatically cleanup the underlying SCSI device on
ufshcd destruction, without requiring explicit calls to
ufshcd_dealloc_host(). This way:

    * the crypto profile and all other ufs_hba-owned resources are
      destroyed before SCSI (as they've been registered after)
    * a memleak is plugged in tc-dwc-g210-pci.c remove() as a
      side-effect
    * EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(ufshcd_dealloc_host) can be removed fully as
      it's not needed anymore
    * no future drivers using ufshcd_alloc_host() could ever forget
      adding the cleanup",,,

wifi: brcmfmac: fix NULL pointer dereference in brcmf_txfinalize()

On removal of the device or unloading of the kernel module a potential NULL
pointer dereference occurs.

The following sequence deletes the interface:

  brcmf_detach()
    brcmf_remove_interface()
      brcmf_del_if()

Inside the brcmf_del_if() function the drvr->if2bss[ifidx] is updated to
BRCMF_BSSIDX_INVALID (-1) if the bsscfgidx matches.

After brcmf_remove_interface() call the brcmf_proto_detach() function is
called providing the following sequence:

  brcmf_detach()
    brcmf_proto_detach()
      brcmf_proto_msgbuf_detach()

call to brcmf_txfinalize() will result in a NULL pointer dereference inside
brcmf_txfinalize() when trying to update ifp->ndev->stats.tx_errors.

CVE-2025-21751,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5: HWS, change error flow on matcher disconnect

Currently, when firmware failure occurs during matcher disconnect flow,
the error flow of the function reconnects the matcher back and returns
an error, which continues running the calling function and eventually
frees the matcher that is being disconnected.
This leads to a case where we have a freed matcher on the matchers list,
which in turn leads to use-after-free and eventual crash.

This patch fixes that by not trying to reconnect the matcher back when
some FW command fails during disconnect.

Note that we're dealing here with FW error. We can't overcome this
problem. This might lead to bad steering state (e.g. wrong connection
between matchers), and will also lead to resource leakage, as it is
the case with any other error handling during resource destruction.

However, the goal here is to allow the driver to continue and not crash
the machine with use-after-free error.",,,

CVE-2025-21753,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix use-after-free when attempting to join an aborted transaction

When we are trying to join the current transaction and if it's aborted,
we read its 'aborted' field after unlocking fs_info->trans_lock and
without holding any extra reference count on it. This means that a
concurrent task that is aborting the transaction may free the transaction
before we read its 'aborted' field, leading to a use-after-free.

Fix this by reading the 'aborted' field while holding fs_info->trans_lock
since any freeing task must first acquire that lock and set
fs_info->running_transaction to NULL before freeing the transaction.

CVE-2025-21754,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix assertion failure when splitting ordered extent after transaction abort

If while we are doing a direct IO write a transaction abort happens, we
mark all existing ordered extents with the BTRFS_ORDERED_IOERR flag (done
at btrfs_destroy_ordered_extents()), and then after that if we enter
btrfs_split_ordered_extent() and the ordered extent has bytes left
(meaning we have a bio that doesn't cover the whole ordered extent, see
details at btrfs_extract_ordered_extent()), we will fail on the following
assertion at btrfs_split_ordered_extent():

   ASSERT(!(flags & ~BTRFS_ORDERED_TYPE_FLAGS));

because the BTRFS_ORDERED_IOERR flag is set and the definition of
BTRFS_ORDERED_TYPE_FLAGS is just the union of all flags that identify the
type of write (regular, nocow, prealloc, compressed, direct IO, encoded).

Fix this by returning an error from btrfs_extract_ordered_extent() if we
find the BTRFS_ORDERED_IOERR flag in the ordered extent. The error will
be the error that resulted in the transaction abort or -EIO if no
transaction abort happened.

Prevents socket unbinding during a transport reassignment, which fixes a

It is due to the fact that clocksource_verify_choose_cpus() is invoked with
preemption disabled.  This function invokes get_random_u32() to obtain
random numbers for choosing CPUs.  The batched_entropy_32 local lock and/or
the base_crng.lock spinlock in driver/char/random.c will be acquired during

be acquired in atomic context.

Fix this problem by using migrate_disable() to allow smp_processor_id() to
be reliably used without introducing atomic context. preempt_disable() is
then called after clocksource_verify_choose_cpus() but before the

cgroup and autogroup migrations and scx_move_task() tried to filter out

ring-buffer: Validate the persistent meta data subbuf array

The meta data for a mapped ring buffer contains an array of indexes of all
the subbuffers. The first entry is the reader page, and the rest of the
entries lay out the order of the subbuffers in how the ring buffer link
list is to be created.

The validator currently makes sure that all the entries are within the

duplicates.

While working on the ring buffer, I corrupted this array, where I added
duplicates. The validator did not catch it and created the ring buffer
link list on top of it. Luckily, the corruption was only that the reader
page was also in the writer path and only presented corrupted data but did
not crash the kernel. But if there were duplicates in the writer side,
then it could corrupt the ring buffer link list and cause a crash.

Create a bitmask array with the size of the number of subbuffers. Then
clear it. When walking through the subbuf array checking to see if the
entries are within the range, test if its bit is already set in the
subbuf_mask. If it is, then there is duplicates and fail the validation.

And uses that in:

	vm_insert_pages(vma, vma->vm_start, pages, &nr_pages);

But virt_to_page() does not work with vmap()'d memory which is what the
persistent ring buffer has. It is rather trivial to allow this, but for
now just disable mmap() of instances that have their ring buffer from the
reserve_mem option.

ax25: Fix refcount leak caused by setting SO_BINDTODEVICE sockopt

If an AX25 device is bound to a socket by setting the SO_BINDTODEVICE
socket option, a refcount leak will occur in ax25_release().

Commit 9fd75b66b8f6 (""ax25: Fix refcount leaks caused by ax25_cb_del()"")
added decrement of device refcounts in ax25_release(). In order for that
to work correctly the refcounts must already be incremented when the
device is bound to the socket. An AX25 device can be bound to a socket
by either calling ax25_bind() or setting SO_BINDTODEVICE socket option.
In both cases the refcounts should be incremented, but in fact it is done
only in ax25_bind().

net: ethernet: ti: am65-cpsw: fix freeing IRQ in am65_cpsw_nuss_remove_tx_chns()

When getting the IRQ we use k3_udma_glue_tx_get_irq() which returns
negative error value on error. So not NULL check is not sufficient
to deteremine if IRQ is valid. Check that IRQ is greater then zero
to ensure it is valid.

There is no issue at probe time but at runtime user can invoke
.set_channels which results in the following call chain.
am65_cpsw_set_channels()
 am65_cpsw_nuss_update_tx_rx_chns()
  am65_cpsw_nuss_remove_tx_chns()
  am65_cpsw_nuss_init_tx_chns()

At this point if am65_cpsw_nuss_init_tx_chns() fails due to
k3_udma_glue_tx_get_irq() then tx_chn->irq will be set to a
negative value.

Then, at subsequent .set_channels with higher channel count we
will attempt to free an invalid IRQ in am65_cpsw_nuss_remove_tx_chns()
leading to a kernel warning.

The root cause is acpi_enable_all_wakeup_gpes() uses a mutex to protect
acpi_hw_enable_all_wakeup_gpes(), and acpi_ut_acquire_mutex() may cause
a thread switch. Since there is no longer concurrent execution during
loongarch_acpi_suspend(), we can call acpi_hw_enable_all_wakeup_gpes()
directly in enable_gpe_wakeup().

CVE-2025-21804,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: rcar-ep: Fix incorrect variable used when calling devm_request_mem_region()

The rcar_pcie_parse_outbound_ranges() uses the devm_request_mem_region()
macro to request a needed resource. A string variable that lives on the
stack is then used to store a dynamically computed resource name, which
is then passed on as one of the macro arguments. This can lead to
undefined behavior.

Depending on the current contents of the memory, the manifestations of
errors may vary. One possible output may be as follows:

  $ cat /proc/iomem
  30000000-37ffffff :
  38000000-3fffffff :

Sometimes, garbage may appear after the colon.

In very rare cases, if no NULL-terminator is found in memory, the system
might crash because the string iterator will overrun which can lead to
access of unmapped memory above the stack.

Thus, fix this by replacing outbound_name with the name of the previously
requested resource. With the changes applied, the output will be as
follows:

  $ cat /proc/iomem
  30000000-37ffffff : memory2
  38000000-3fffffff : memory3

The reproduction command is as follows:

This is because when the napi's weight is set to 0, process_backlog() may
return 0 and clear the NAPI_STATE_SCHED bit of napi->state, causing this
napi to be re-polled in net_rx_action() until __do_softirq() times out.
Since the NAPI_STATE_SCHED bit has been cleared, napi_schedule_rps() can
be retriggered in enqueue_to_backlog(), causing this issue.

Making the napi's weight always non-zero solves this problem.

Triggering this issue requires system-wide admin (setting is
not namespaced).",,,

block: fix queue freeze vs limits lock order in sysfs store methods

queue_attr_store() always freezes a device queue before calling the
attribute store operation. For attributes that control queue limits, the
store operation will also lock the queue limits with a call to
queue_limits_start_update(). However, some drivers (e.g. SCSI sd) may
need to issue commands to a device to obtain limit values from the
hardware with the queue limits locked. This creates a potential ABBA
deadlock situation if a user attempts to modify a limit (thus freezing
the device queue) while the device driver starts a revalidation of the
device queue limits.

Avoid such deadlock by not freezing the queue before calling the
->store_limit() method in struct queue_sysfs_entry and instead use the
queue_limits_commit_update_frozen helper to freeze the queue after taking
the limits lock.

This also removes taking the sysfs lock for the store_limit method as
it doesn't protect anything here, but creates even more nesting.
Hopefully it will go away from the actual sysfs methods entirely soon.

rxrpc, afs: Fix peer hash locking vs RCU callback

In its address list, afs now retains pointers to and refs on one or more
rxrpc_peer objects.  The address list is freed under RCU and at this time,
it puts the refs on those peers.

Now, when an rxrpc_peer object runs out of refs, it gets removed from the
peer hash table and, for that, rxrpc has to take a spinlock.  However, it
is now being called from afs's RCU cleanup, which takes place in BH
context - but it is just taking an ordinary spinlock.

The put may also be called from non-BH context, and so there exists the
possibility of deadlock if the BH-based RCU cleanup happens whilst the hash
spinlock is held.  This led to the attached lockdep complaint.

Fix this by changing spinlocks of rxnet->peer_hash_lock back to
BH-disabling locks.

// All members of @iter are wild pointers.
struct class_dev_iter iter;

// class_dev_iter_init(@iter, @class, ...) checks parameter @class for
// potential class_to_subsys() error, and it returns void type and does

CVE-2025-21813,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

timers/migration: Fix off-by-one root mis-connection

Before attaching a new root to the old root, the children counter of the
new root is checked to verify that only the upcoming CPU's top group have
been connected to it. However since the recently added commit b729cc1ec21a
(""timers/migration: Fix another race between hotplug and idle entry/exit"")
this check is not valid anymore because the old root is pre-accounted
as a child to the new root. Therefore after connecting the upcoming
CPU's top group to the new root, the children count to be expected must
be 2 and not 1 anymore.

This omission results in the old root to not be connected to the new
root. Then eventually the system may run with more than one top level,
which defeats the purpose of a single idle migrator.

Also the old root is pre-accounted but not connected upon the new root
creation. But it can be connected to the new root later on. Therefore
the old root may be accounted twice to the new root. The propagation of
such overcommit can end up creating a double final top-level root with a
groupmask incorrectly initialized. Although harmless given that the final
top level roots will never have a parent to walk up to, this oddity
opportunistically reported the core issue:

CVE-2025-21816,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hrtimers: Force migrate away hrtimers queued after CPUHP_AP_HRTIMERS_DYING

hrtimers are migrated away from the dying CPU to any online target at
the CPUHP_AP_HRTIMERS_DYING stage in order not to delay bandwidth timers
handling tasks involved in the CPU hotplug forward progress.

However wakeups can still be performed by the outgoing CPU after
CPUHP_AP_HRTIMERS_DYING. Those can result again in bandwidth timers being
armed. Depending on several considerations (crystal ball power management
based election, earliest timer already enqueued, timer migration enabled or
not), the target may eventually be the current CPU even if offline. If that
happens, the timer is eventually ignored.

The most notable example is RCU which had to deal with each and every of
those wake-ups by deferring them to an online CPU, along with related
workarounds:

_ e787644caf76 (rcu: Defer RCU kthreads wakeup when CPU is dying)
_ 9139f93209d1 (rcu/nocb: Fix RT throttling hrtimer armed from offline CPU)
_ f7345ccc62a4 (rcu/nocb: Fix rcuog wake-up from offline softirq)

The problem isn't confined to RCU though as the stop machine kthread
(which runs CPUHP_AP_HRTIMERS_DYING) reports its completion at the end
of its work through cpu_stop_signal_done() and performs a wake up that
eventually arms the deadline server timer:

CVE-2025-21823,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

batman-adv: Drop unmanaged ELP metric worker

The ELP worker needs to calculate new metric values for all neighbors
""reachable"" over an interface. Some of the used metric sources require
locks which might need to sleep. This sleep is incompatible with the RCU
list iterator used for the recorded neighbors. The initial approach to work
around of this problem was to queue another work item per neighbor and then
run this in a new context.

Even when this solved the RCU vs might_sleep() conflict, it has a major
problems: Nothing was stopping the work item in case it is not needed
anymore - for example because one of the related interfaces was removed or
the batman-adv module was unloaded - resulting in potential invalid memory
accesses.

Directly canceling the metric worker also has various problems:

* cancel_work_sync for a to-be-deactivated interface is called with
  rtnl_lock held. But the code in the ELP metric worker also tries to use
  rtnl_lock() - which will never return in this case. This also means that
  cancel_work_sync would never return because it is waiting for the worker
  to finish.
* iterating over the neighbor list for the to-be-deactivated interface is
  currently done using the RCU specific methods. Which means that it is
  possible to miss items when iterating over it without the associated
  spinlock - a behaviour which is acceptable for a periodic metric check
  but not for a cleanup routine (which must ""stop"" all still running
  workers)

The better approch is to get rid of the per interface neighbor metric
worker and handle everything in the interface worker. The original problems
are solved by:

* creating a list of neighbors which require new metric information inside
  the RCU protected context, gathering the metric according to the new list
  outside the RCU protected context
* only use rcu_trylock inside metric gathering code to avoid a deadlock
  when the cancel_delayed_work_sync is called in the interface removal code
  (which is called with the rtnl_lock held)",,,

It seems feasible to break the reuse and refill of per-cpu extra_elems
into two independent parts: reuse the per-cpu extra_elems with bucket
lock being held and refill the old_element as per-cpu extra_elems after
the bucket lock is unlocked. However, it will make the concurrent
overwrite procedures on the same CPU return unexpected -E2BIG error when
the map is full.

Therefore, the patch fixes the lock problem by breaking the cancelling
of bpf_timer into two steps for PREEMPT_RT:
1) use hrtimer_try_to_cancel() and check its return value
2) if the timer is running, use hrtimer_cancel() through a kworker to
   cancel it again
Considering that the current implementation of hrtimer_cancel() will try
to acquire a being held softirq_expiry_lock when the current timer is
running, these steps above are reasonable. However, it also has
downside. When the timer is running, the cancelling of the timer is
delayed when releasing the last map uref. The delay is also fixable
(e.g., break the cancelling of bpf timer into two parts: one part in
locked scope, another one in unlocked scope), it can be revised later if
necessary.

It is a bit hard to decide the right fix tag. One reason is that the
problem depends on PREEMPT_RT which is enabled in v6.12. Considering the
softirq_expiry_lock lock exists since v5.4 and bpf_timer is introduced
in v5.15, the bpf_timer commit is used in the fixes tag and an extra
depends-on tag is added to state the dependency on PREEMPT_RT.

PCI: Avoid putting some root ports into D3 on TUXEDO Sirius Gen1

commit 9d26d3a8f1b0 (""PCI: Put PCIe ports into D3 during suspend"") sets the
policy that all PCIe ports are allowed to use D3.  When the system is
suspended if the port is not power manageable by the platform and won't be

seccomp: passthrough uretprobe systemcall without filtering

When attaching uretprobes to processes running inside docker, the attached

The reason is that now that uretprobe is a system call the default seccomp
filters in docker block it as they only allow a specific set of known
syscalls. This is true for other userspace applications which use seccomp
to control their syscall surface.

Since uretprobe is a ""kernel implementation detail"" system call which is
not used by userspace application code directly, it is impractical and
there's very little point in forcing all userspace applications to
explicitly allow it in order to avoid crashing tracked processes.

Pass this systemcall through seccomp without depending on configuration.

KVM: x86: Load DR6 with guest value only before entering .vcpu_run() loop

Move the conditional loading of hardware DR6 with the guest's DR6 value
out of the core .vcpu_run() loop to fix a bug where KVM can load hardware
with a stale vcpu->arch.dr6.

When the guest accesses a DR and host userspace isn't debugging the guest,
KVM disables DR interception and loads the guest's values into hardware on
VM-Enter and saves them on VM-Exit.  This allows the guest to access DRs
at will, e.g. so that a sequence of DR accesses to configure a breakpoint
only generates one VM-Exit.

For DR0-DR3, the logic/behavior is identical between VMX and SVM, and also
identical between KVM_DEBUGREG_BP_ENABLED (userspace debugging the guest)
and KVM_DEBUGREG_WONT_EXIT (guest using DRs), and so KVM handles loading
DR0-DR3 in common code, _outside_ of the core kvm_x86_ops.vcpu_run() loop.

But for DR6, the guest's value doesn't need to be loaded into hardware for
KVM_DEBUGREG_BP_ENABLED, and SVM provides a dedicated VMCB field whereas
VMX requires software to manually load the guest value, and so loading the
guest's value into DR6 is handled by {svm,vmx}_vcpu_run(), i.e. is done
_inside_ the core run loop.

Unfortunately, saving the guest values on VM-Exit is initiated by common
x86, again outside of the core run loop.  If the guest modifies DR6 (in
hardware, when DR interception is disabled), and then the next VM-Exit is
a fastpath VM-Exit, KVM will reload hardware DR6 with vcpu->arch.dr6 and
clobber the guest's actual value.

The bug shows up primarily with nested VMX because KVM handles the VMX
preemption timer in the fastpath, and the window between hardware DR6
being modified (in guest context) and DR6 being read by guest software is
orders of magnitude larger in a nested setup.  E.g. in non-nested, the
VMX preemption timer would need to fire precisely between #DB injection
and the #DB handler's read of DR6, whereas with a KVM-on-KVM setup, the
window where hardware DR6 is ""dirty"" extends all the way from L1 writing
DR6 to VMRESUME (in L1).

segmentation fault after commit 1773572863c4 (""thermal: netlink: Add the

Although intel_lpmd can be updated to check the THERMAL_GENL_VERSION and

CVE-2025-21846,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

acct: perform last write from workqueue

In [1] it was reported that the acct(2) system call can be used to
trigger NULL deref in cases where it is set to write to a file that
triggers an internal lookup. This can e.g., happen when pointing acc(2)
to /sys/power/resume. At the point the where the write to this file
happens the calling task has already exited and called exit_fs(). A
lookup will thus trigger a NULL-deref when accessing current->fs.

Reorganize the code so that the the final write happens from the
workqueue but with the caller's credentials. This preserves the
(strange) permission model and has almost no regression risk.

This api should stop to exist though.",,5.5,CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

bpf: avoid holding freeze_mutex during mmap operation

We use map->freeze_mutex to prevent races between map_freeze() and
memory mapping BPF map contents with writable permissions. The way we
naively do this means we'll hold freeze_mutex for entire duration of all
the mm and VMA manipulations, which is completely unnecessary. This can
potentially also lead to deadlocks, as reported by syzbot in [0].

So, instead, hold freeze_mutex only during writeability checks, bump
(proactively) ""write active"" count for the map, unlock the mutex and
proceed with mmap logic. And only if something went wrong during mmap
logic, then undo that ""write active"" counter increment.

sockmap, vsock: For connectible sockets allow only connected

sockmap expects all vsocks to have a transport assigned, which is expressed
in vsock_proto::psock_update_sk_prot(). However, there is an edge case
where an unconnected (connectible) socket may lose its previously assigned
transport. This is handled with a NULL check in the vsock/BPF recv path.

Another design detail is that listening vsocks are not supposed to have any
transport assigned at all. Which implies they are not supported by the
sockmap. But this is complicated by the fact that a socket, before
switching to TCP_LISTEN, may have had some transport assigned during a
failed connect() attempt. Hence, we may end up with a listening vsock in a
sockmap, which blows up quickly:

The net here could differ from dev_net(dev) if IFLA_NET_NS_PID,

When dev_net(dev) is dismantled, geneve_exit_batch_rtnl() finally
calls unregister_netdevice_queue() for each dev in the netns,
and later the dev is freed.

However, its geneve_dev.next is still linked to the backend UDP

Then, use-after-free will occur when another geneve dev is created
in the netns.

CVE-2025-21860,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/zswap: fix inconsistency when zswap_store_page() fails

Commit b7c0ccdfbafd (""mm: zswap: support large folios in zswap_store()"")
skips charging any zswap entries when it failed to zswap the entire folio.

However, when some base pages are zswapped but it failed to zswap the
entire folio, the zswap operation is rolled back.  When freeing zswap
entries for those pages, zswap_entry_free() uncharges the zswap entries
that were not previously charged, causing zswap charging to become
inconsistent.

This inconsistency triggers two warnings with following steps:
  # On a machine with 64GiB of RAM and 36GiB of zswap
  $ stress-ng --bigheap 2 # wait until the OOM-killer kills stress-ng
  $ sudo reboot

  The two warnings are:
    in mm/memcontrol.c:163, function obj_cgroup_release():
      WARN_ON_ONCE(nr_bytes & (PAGE_SIZE - 1));

    in mm/page_counter.c:60, function page_counter_cancel():
      if (WARN_ONCE(new < 0, ""page_counter underflow: %ld nr_pages=%lu\n"",
	  new, nr_pages))

zswap_stored_pages also becomes inconsistent in the same way.

As suggested by Kanchana, increment zswap_stored_pages and charge zswap
entries within zswap_store_page() when it succeeds.  This way,
zswap_entry_free() will decrement the counter and uncharge the entries
when it failed to zswap the entire folio.

While this could potentially be optimized by batching objcg charging and
incrementing the counter, let's focus on fixing the bug this time and
leave the optimization for later after some evaluation.

After resolving the inconsistency, the warnings disappear.

CVE-2025-21861,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/migrate_device: don't add folio to be freed to LRU in migrate_device_finalize()

If migration succeeded, we called
folio_migrate_flags()->mem_cgroup_migrate() to migrate the memcg from the
old to the new folio.  This will set memcg_data of the old folio to 0.

Similarly, if migration failed, memcg_data of the dst folio is left unset.

If we call folio_putback_lru() on such folios (memcg_data == 0), we will
add the folio to be freed to the LRU, making memcg code unhappy.  Running

If drop_monitor is built as a kernel module, syzkaller may have time
to send a netlink NET_DM_CMD_START message during the module loading.
This will call the net_dm_monitor_start() function that uses
a spinlock that has not yet been initialized.

To fix this, let's place resource initialization above the registration
of a generic netlink family.

tcp: drop secpath at the same time as we currently drop dst

Xiumei reported hitting the WARN in xfrm6_tunnel_net_exit while
running tests that boil down to:
 - create a pair of netns
 - run a basic TCP test over ipcomp6
 - delete the pair of netns

The xfrm_state found on spi_byaddr was not deleted at the time we
delete the netns, because we still have a reference on it. This
lingering reference comes from a secpath (which holds a ref on the
xfrm_state), which is still attached to an skb. This skb is not
leaked, it ends up on sk_receive_queue and then gets defer-free'd by
skb_attempt_defer_free.

The problem happens when we defer freeing an skb (push it on one CPU's
defer_list), and don't flush that list before the netns is deleted. In
that case, we still have a reference on the xfrm_state that we don't
expect at this point.

We already drop the skb's dst in the TCP receive path when it's no
longer needed, so let's also drop the secpath. At this point,
tcp_filter has already called into the LSM hooks that may require the
secpath, so it should not be needed anymore. However, in some of those
places, the MPTCP extension has just been attached to the skb, so we
cannot simply drop all extensions.",,5.5,CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
CVE-2025-21865,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gtp: Suppress list corruption splat in gtp_net_exit_batch_rtnl().

Brad Spengler reported the list_del() corruption splat in
gtp_net_exit_batch_rtnl(). [0]

Commit eb28fd76c0a0 (""gtp: Destroy device along with udp socket's netns
dismantle."") added the for_each_netdev() loop in gtp_net_exit_batch_rtnl()
to destroy devices in each netns as done in geneve and ip tunnels.

However, this could trigger ->dellink() twice for the same device during
->exit_batch_rtnl().

Say we have two netns A & B and gtp device B that resides in netns B but
whose UDP socket is in netns A.

  1. cleanup_net() processes netns A and then B.

  2. gtp_net_exit_batch_rtnl() finds the device B while iterating
     netns A's gn->gtp_dev_list and calls ->dellink().

  [ device B is not yet unlinked from netns B
    as unregister_netdevice_many() has not been called. ]

  3. gtp_net_exit_batch_rtnl() finds the device B while iterating
     netns B's for_each_netdev() and calls ->dellink().

gtp_dellink() cleans up the device's hash table, unlinks the dev from
gn->gtp_dev_list, and calls unregister_netdevice_queue().

Basically, calling gtp_dellink() multiple times is fine unless
CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST is enabled.

Let's remove for_each_netdev() in gtp_net_exit_batch_rtnl() and
delegate the destruction to default_device_exit_batch() as done
in bareudp.

f8 corresponds to KASAN_VMALLOC_INVALID which means the area is not
initialised hence not supposed to be used yet.

Powerpc text patching infrastructure allocates a virtual memory area
using get_vm_area() and flags it as VM_ALLOC. But that flag is meant
to be used for vmalloc() and vmalloc() allocated memory is not
supposed to be used before a call to __vmalloc_node_range() which is
never called for that area.

That went undetected until commit e4137f08816b (""mm, kasan, kmsan:
instrument copy_from/to_kernel_nofault"")

The area allocated by text_area_cpu_up() is not vmalloc memory, it is
mapped directly on demand when needed by map_kernel_page(). There is
no VM flag corresponding to such usage, so just pass no flag. That way
the area will be unpoisonned and usable immediately.",,5.5,CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
CVE-2025-21867,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf, test_run: Fix use-after-free issue in eth_skb_pkt_type()

KMSAN reported a use-after-free issue in eth_skb_pkt_type()[1]. The
cause of the issue was that eth_skb_pkt_type() accessed skb's data
that didn't contain an Ethernet header. This occurs when
bpf_prog_test_run_xdp() passes an invalid value as the user_data
argument to bpf_test_init().

Fix this by returning an error when user_data is less than ETH_HLEN in
bpf_test_init(). Additionally, remove the check for ""if (user_size >
size)"" as it is unnecessary.

is smaller than GRO_MAX_HEAD.

Such built additionally contains the revert of the single page frag cache
so that napi_get_frags() ends up using the page frag allocator, triggering
the splat.

Note that the underlying issue is independent from the mentioned
revert; address it ensuring that the small head cache will fit either TCP
and GRO allocation and updating napi_alloc_skb() and __netdev_alloc_skb()
to select kmalloc() usage for any allocation fitting such cache.",,,

Commit c28c15b6d28a (""powerpc/code-patching: Use temporary mm for
Radix MMU"") is inspired from x86 but unlike x86 is doesn't disable
KASAN reports during patching. This wasn't a problem at the begining
because __patch_mem() is not instrumented.

Commit 465cabc97b42 (""powerpc/code-patching: introduce
patch_instructions()"") use copy_to_kernel_nofault() to copy several
instructions at once. But when using temporary mm the destination is
not regular kernel memory but a kind of kernel-like memory located
in user address space.

ASoC: SOF: ipc4-topology: Harden loops for looking up ALH copiers

Other, non DAI copier widgets could have the same  stream name (sname) as
the ALH copier and in that case the copier->data is NULL, no alh_data is
attached, which could lead to NULL pointer dereference.
We could check for this NULL pointer in sof_ipc4_prepare_copier_module()
and avoid the crash, but a similar loop in sof_ipc4_widget_setup_comp_dai()
will miscalculate the ALH device count, causing broken audio.

The correct fix is to harden the matching logic by making sure that the
1. widget is a DAI widget - so dai = w->private is valid
2. the dai (and thus the copier) is ALH copier",,,

tee: optee: Fix supplicant wait loop

OP-TEE supplicant is a user-space daemon and it's possible for it
be hung or crashed or killed in the middle of processing an OP-TEE
RPC call. It becomes more complicated when there is incorrect shutdown
ordering of the supplicant process vs the OP-TEE client application which
can eventually lead to system hang-up waiting for the closure of the
client application.

Allow the client process waiting in kernel for supplicant response to
be killed rather than indefinitely waiting in an unkillable state. Also,
a normal uninterruptible wait should not have resulted in the hung-task
watchdog getting triggered, but the endless loop would.

This fixes issues observed during system reboot/shutdown when supplicant
got hung for some reason or gets crashed/killed which lead to client
getting hung in an unkillable state. It in turn lead to system being in

Indeed the PM can try to send a RM_ADDR over a msk without acquiring
first the msk socket lock.

The bugged code-path comes from an early optimization: when there
are no subflows, the PM should (usually) not send RM_ADDR
notifications.

The above statement is incorrect, as without locks another process
could concur

i2c: npcm: disable interrupt enable bit before devm_request_irq

The customer reports that there is a soft lockup issue related to
the i2c driver. After checking, the i2c module was doing a tx transfer
and the bmc machine reboots in the middle of the i2c transaction, the i2c
module keeps the status without being reset.

Due to such an i2c module status, the i2c irq handler keeps getting
triggered since the i2c irq handler is registered in the kernel booting
process after the bmc machine is doing a warm rebooting.
The continuous triggering is stopped by the soft lockup watchdog timer.

Disable the interrupt enable bit in the i2c module before calling
devm_request_irq to fix this issue since the i2c relative status bit
is read-only.

Here is the soft lockup log.

CVE-2025-21879,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix use-after-free on inode when scanning root during em shrinking

At btrfs_scan_root() we are accessing the inode's root (and fs_info) in a
call to btrfs_fs_closing() after we have scheduled the inode for a delayed
iput, and that can result in a use-after-free on the inode in case the
cleaner kthread does the iput before we dereference the inode in the call
to btrfs_fs_closing().

Fix this by using the fs_info stored already in a local variable instead
of doing inode->root->fs_info.",,,
CVE-2025-21880,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe/userptr: fix EFAULT handling

Currently we treat EFAULT from hmm_range_fault() as a non-fatal error
when called from xe_vm_userptr_pin() with the idea that we want to avoid
killing the entire vm and chucking an error, under the assumption that
the user just did an unmap or something, and has no intention of
actually touching that memory from the GPU.  At this point we have
already zapped the PTEs so any access should generate a page fault, and
if the pin fails there also it will then become fatal.

However it looks like it's possible for the userptr vma to still be on
the rebind list in preempt_rebind_work_func(), if we had to retry the
pin again due to something happening in the caller before we did the
rebind step, but in the meantime needing to re-validate the userptr and
this time hitting the EFAULT.

This explains an internal user report of hitting:

The cause is that zero pfn is set to the PTE without increasing the RSS
count in mfill_atomic_pte_zeropage() and the refcount of zero folio does
not increase accordingly. Then, the operation on the same pfn is performed
in uprobe_write_opcode()->__replace_page() to unconditional decrease the
RSS count and old_folio's refcount.

Therefore, two bugs are introduced:

 1. The RSS count is incorrect, when process exit, the check_mm() report
    error ""Bad rss-count"".

 2. The reserved folio (zero folio) is freed when folio->refcount is zero,
    then free_pages_prepare->free_page_is_bad() report error
    ""Bad page state"".

There is more, the following warning could also theoretically be triggered:

  __replace_page()
    -> ...
      -> folio_remove_rmap_pte()
        -> VM_WARN_ON_FOLIO(is_zero_folio(folio), folio)

Considering that uprobe hit on the zero folio is a very rare case, just
reject zero old folio immediately after get_user_page_vma_remote().

net: better track kernel sockets lifetime

While kernel sockets are dismantled during pernet_operations->exit(),
their freeing can be delayed by any tx packets still held in qdisc

CVE-2025-21888,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/mlx5: Fix a WARN during dereg_mr for DM type

Memory regions (MR) of type DM (device memory) do not have an associated
umem.

In the __mlx5_ib_dereg_mr() -> mlx5_free_priv_descs() flow, the code
incorrectly takes the wrong branch, attempting to call
dma_unmap_single() on a DMA address that is not mapped.

This results in a WARN [1], as shown below.

The issue is resolved by properly accounting for the DM type and
ensuring the correct branch is selected in mlx5_free_priv_descs().

CVE-2025-21892,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/mlx5: Fix the recovery flow of the UMR QP

This patch addresses an issue in the recovery flow of the UMR QP,
ensuring tasks do not get stuck, as highlighted by the call trace [1].

During recovery, before transitioning the QP to the RESET state, the
software must wait for all outstanding WRs to complete.

Failing to do so can cause the firmware to skip sending some flushed
CQEs with errors and simply discard them upon the RESET, as per the IB
specification.

This race condition can result in lost CQEs and tasks becoming stuck.

To resolve this, the patch sends a final WR which serves only as a
barrier before moving the QP state to RESET.

Once a CQE is received for that final WR, it guarantees that no
outstanding WRs remain, making it safe to transition the QP to RESET and
subsequently back to RTS, restoring proper functionality.

Note:
For the barrier WR, we simply reuse the failed and ready WR.
Since the QP is in an error state, it will only receive
IB_WC_WR_FLUSH_ERR. However, as it serves only as a barrier we don't
care about its status.

Starting in version 4.0.0-beta.18 and prior to 4.0.0-beta.253, a vulnerability in the execution of commands on remote servers allows an authenticated user to execute arbitrary code on the local Coolify container, gaining access to data and private keys or tokens of other users/teams. The ability to inject malicious commands into the Coolify container gives authenticated attackers the ability to fully retrieve and control the data and availability of the software. Centrally hosted Coolify instances (open registration and/or multiple teams with potentially untrustworthy users) are especially at risk, as sensitive data of all users and connected servers can be leaked by any user. Additionally, attackers are able to modify the running software, potentially deploying malicious images to remote nodes or generally changing its behavior.

CVE-2025-22828,"CloudStack users can add and read comments (annotations) on resources they are authorised to access. 

Due to an access validation issue that affects Apache CloudStack versions from 4.16.0, users who have access, prior access or knowledge of resource UUIDs can list and add comments (annotations) to such resources. 

An attacker with a user-account and access or prior knowledge of resource UUIDs may exploit this issue to read contents of the comments (annotations) or add malicious comments (annotations) to such resources. 

This may cause potential loss of confidentiality of CloudStack environments and resources if the comments (annotations) contain any privileged information. However, guessing or brute-forcing resource UUIDs are generally hard to impossible and access to listing or adding comments isn't same as access to CloudStack resources, making this issue of very low severity and general low impact.

CVE-2025-23028,"Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane. A denial of service vulnerability affects versions 1.14.0 through 1.14.7, 1.15.0 through 1.15.11, and 1.16.0 through 1.16.4. In a Kubernetes cluster where Cilium is configured to proxy DNS traffic, an attacker can crash Cilium agents by sending a crafted DNS response to workloads from outside the cluster. For traffic that is allowed but without using DNS-based policy, the dataplane will continue to pass traffic as configured at the time of the DoS. For workloads that have DNS-based policy configured, existing connections may continue to operate, and new connections made without relying on DNS resolution may continue to be established, but new connections which rely on DNS resolution may be disrupted. Any configuration changes that affect the impacted agent may not be applied until the agent is able to restart. This issue is fixed in Cilium v1.14.18, v1.15.12, and v1.16.5.

CVE-2025-23040,"GitHub Desktop is an open-source Electron-based GitHub app designed for git development. An attacker convincing a user to clone a repository directly or through a submodule can allow the attacker access to the user's credentials through the use of maliciously crafted remote URL. GitHub Desktop relies on Git to perform all network related operations (such as cloning, fetching, and pushing). When a user attempts to clone a repository GitHub Desktop will invoke `git clone` and when Git encounters a remote which requires authentication it will request the credentials for that remote host from GitHub Desktop using the git-credential protocol. Using a maliciously crafted URL it's possible to cause the credential request coming from Git to be misinterpreted by Github Desktop such that it will send credentials for a different host than the host that Git is currently communicating with thereby allowing for secret exfiltration. GitHub username and OAuth token, or credentials for other Git remote hosts stored in GitHub Desktop could be improperly transmitted to an unrelated host.

A Security vulnerability has been found starting in version 1.0.0 and prior to 1.10.3 and 1.11.3 on several director endpoints of REST API. To reproduce this vulnerability an authenticated user with permission to access the Director is required (plus api access with regard to the api endpoints). And even though some of these Icinga Director users are restricted from accessing certain objects, are able to retrieve information related to them if their name is known. This makes it possible to change the configuration of these objects by those Icinga Director users restricted from accessing them.

Affected endpoints include icingaweb2/director/service, if the host name is left out of the query; icingaweb2/directore/notification; icingaweb2/director/serviceset; and icingaweb2/director/scheduled-downtime. In addition, the endpoint `icingaweb2/director/services?host=filteredHostName` returns a status code 200 even though the services for the host is filtered. This in turn lets the restricted user know that the host `filteredHostName` exists even though the user is restricted from accessing it.

CVE-2025-24017,"YesWiki is a wiki system written in PHP. Versions up to and including 4.4.5 are vulnerable to any end-user crafting a DOM based XSS on all of YesWiki's pages which is triggered when a user clicks on a malicious link. The vulnerability makes use of the search by tag feature. When a tag doesn't exist, the tag is reflected on the page and isn't properly sanitized on the server side which allows a malicious user to generate a link that will trigger an XSS on the client's side when clicked. This vulnerability allows any user to generate a malicious link that will trigger an account takeover when clicked, therefore allowing a user to steal other accounts, modify pages, comments, permissions, extract user data (emails), thus impacting the integrity, availability and confidentiality of a YesWiki instance. Version 4.5.0 contains a patch for the issue.",,,
CVE-2025-24018,"YesWiki is a wiki system written in PHP. In versions up to and including 4.4.5, it is possible for an authenticated user with rights to edit/create a page or comment to trigger a stored XSS which will be reflected on any page where the resource is loaded. The vulnerability makes use of the content edition feature and more specifically of the `{{attach}}` component allowing users to attach files/medias to a page. When a file is attached using the `{{attach}}` component, if the resource contained in the `file` attribute doesn't exist, then the server will generate a file upload button containing the filename. This vulnerability allows any malicious authenticated user that has the right to create a comment or edit a page to be able to steal accounts and therefore modify pages, comments, permissions, extract user data (emails), thus impacting the integrity, availability and confidentiality of a YesWiki instance. Version 4.5.0 contains a patch for the issue.",,,

In versions up to and including 4.4.5, it is possible for any authenticated user, through the use of the filemanager to delete any file owned by the user running the FastCGI Process Manager (FPM) on the host without any limitation on the filesystem's scope. This vulnerability allows any authenticated user to arbitrarily remove content from the Wiki resulting in partial loss of data and defacement/deterioration of the website. In the context of a container installation of YesWiki without any modification, the `yeswiki` files (for example .php) are not owned by the same user (root) as the one running the FPM process (www-data). However in a standard installation, www-data may also be the owner of the PHP files, allowing a malicious user to completely cut the access to the wiki by deleting all important PHP files (like index.php or core files of YesWiki).

When a user enters no PIN at all, `pam_get_pwd` will never initialize the password buffer pointer and as such `cleanse` will try to dereference an uninitialized pointer. On my system this pointer happens to have the value 3 most of the time when running sudo and as such it will segfault. The most likely impact to a system affected by this issue is an availability impact due to a daemon that uses PAM crashing. As of time of publication, a patch for the issue is unavailable.",,,
CVE-2025-24032,"PAM-PKCS#11 is a Linux-PAM login module that allows a X.509 certificate based user login.

An attacker may create a different token with the user's public data (e.g. the user's certificate) and a PIN known to the attacker. If no signature with the private key is required, then the attacker may now login as user with that created token. The default to *not* check the private key's signature has been changed with commit commi6638576892b59a99389043c90a1e7dd4d783b921, so that all versions starting with pam_pkcs11-0.6.0 should be affected.

Starting in version 0.7.0 and prior to versions 0.7.15 and 0.8.3, Himmelblau is vulnerable to leaking credentials in debug logs. When debug logging is enabled, user access tokens are inadvertently logged, potentially exposing sensitive authentication data. Similarly, Kerberos Ticket-Granting Tickets (TGTs) are logged when debug logging is enabled. Both issues pose a risk of exposing sensitive credentials, particularly in environments where debug logging is enabled. Himmelblau versions 0.7.15 and 0.8.3 contain a patch that fixes both issues. Some workarounds are available for users who are unable to upgrade. For the **logon compliance script issue**, disable the `logon_script` option in `/etc/himmelblau/himmelblau.conf`, and avoid using the `-d` flag when starting the `himmelblaud` daemon.

CVE-2025-24356,"fastd is a VPN daemon which tunnels IP packets and Ethernet frames over UDP. When receiving a data packet from an unknown IP address/port combination, fastd will assume that one of its connected peers has moved to a new address and initiate a reconnect by sending a handshake packet. This ""fast reconnect"" avoids having to wait for a session timeout (up to ~90s) until a new connection is established. Even a 1-byte UDP packet just containing the fastd packet type header can trigger a much larger handshake packet (~150 bytes of UDP payload). Including IPv4 and UDP headers, the resulting amplification factor is roughly 12-13.

Prior to version 1.0.6, if an attacker can control the input to the `asteval` library, they can bypass asteval's restrictions and execute arbitrary Python code in the context of the application using the library. The vulnerability is rooted in how `asteval` performs handling of `FormattedValue` AST nodes. In particular, the `on_formattedvalue` value uses the dangerous format method of the str class. The code allows an attacker to manipulate the value of the string used in the dangerous call `fmt.format(__fstring__=val)`.

CVE-2025-24362,"In some circumstances, debug artifacts uploaded by the CodeQL Action after a failed code scanning workflow run may contain the environment variables from the workflow run, including any secrets that were exposed as environment variables to the workflow. Users with read access to the repository would be able to access this artifact, containing any secrets from the environment. This vulnerability is patched in CodeQL Action version 3.28.3 or later, or CodeQL CLI version 2.20.3 or later.

For some affected workflow runs, the exposed environment variables in the debug artifacts included a valid `GITHUB_TOKEN` for the workflow run, which has access to the repository in which the workflow ran, and all the permissions specified in the workflow or job. The `GITHUB_TOKEN` is valid until the job completes or 24 hours has elapsed, whichever comes first.

Environment variables are exposed only from workflow runs that satisfy all of the following conditions:
- Code scanning workflow configured to scan the Java/Kotlin languages.
- Running in a repository containing Kotlin source code.
- Running with debug artifacts enabled.
- Using CodeQL Action versions <= 3.28.2, and CodeQL CLI versions >= 2.9.2 (May 2022) and <= 2.20.2.
- The workflow run fails before the CodeQL database is finalized within the `github/codeql-action/analyze` step.
- Running in any GitHub environment: GitHub.com, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, and GitHub Enterprise Server. Note: artifacts are only accessible to users within the same GitHub environment with access to the scanned repo.

The `GITHUB_TOKEN` exposed in this way would only have been valid for workflow runs that satisfy all of the following conditions, in addition to the conditions above:
- Using CodeQL Action versions >= 3.26.11 (October 2024) and <= 3.28.2, or >= 2.26.11 and < 3.
- Running in GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise Cloud only (not valid on GitHub Enterprise Server).

In rare cases during advanced setup, logging of environment variables may also occur during database creation of Java, Swift, and C/C++. Please read the corresponding CodeQL CLI advisory GHSA-gqh3-9prg-j95m for more details.

In CodeQL CLI versions >= 2.9.2 and <= 2.20.2, the CodeQL Kotlin extractor logs all environment variables by default into an intermediate file during the process of creating a CodeQL database for Kotlin code. This is a part of the CodeQL CLI and is invoked by the CodeQL Action for analyzing Kotlin repositories. 

On Actions, the environment variables logged include GITHUB_TOKEN, which grants permissions to the repository being scanned.
The intermediate file containing environment variables is deleted when finalizing the database, so it is not included in a successfully created database. It is, however, included in the debug artifact that is uploaded on a failed analysis run if the CodeQL Action was invoked in debug mode.

Therefore, under these specific circumstances (incomplete database creation using the CodeQL Action in debug mode) an attacker with access to the debug artifact would gain unauthorized access to repository secrets from the environment, including both the `GITHUB_TOKEN` and any user-configured secrets made available via environment variables.

The impact of the `GITHUB_TOKEN` leaked in this environment is limited:
- For workflows on GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise Cloud using CodeQL Action versions >= 3.26.11 and <= 3.28.2, or >= 2.26.11 and < 3, which in turn use the `actions/artifacts v4` library, the debug artifact is uploaded before the workflow job completes. During this time the `GITHUB_TOKEN` is still valid, providing an opportunity for attackers to gain access to the repository.
- For all other workflows, the debug artifact is uploaded after the workflow job completes, at which point the leaked `GITHUB_TOKEN` has been revoked and cannot be used to access the repository.",,,
CVE-2025-24363,"The HL7 FHIR IG publisher is a tool to take a set of inputs and create a standard FHIR IG.

This does not impact users that clone public repos without credentials, such as those using the auto-ig-build continuous integration infrastructure. This problem has been patched in release 1.8.9. Some workarounds are available. Users should ensure the IG repo they are publishing does not have username or credentials included in the `origin` URL.

CVE-2025-24371,"CometBFT is a distributed, Byzantine fault-tolerant, deterministic state machine replication engine. In the `blocksync` protocol peers send their `base` and `latest` heights when they connect to a new node (`A`), which is syncing to the tip of a network. `base` acts as a lower ground and informs `A` that the peer only has blocks starting from height `base`. `latest` height informs `A` about the latest block in a network. Normally, nodes would only report increasing heights. If `B` fails to provide the latest block, `B` is removed and the `latest` height (target height) is recalculated based on other nodes `latest` heights. The existing code however doesn't check for the case where `B` first reports `latest` height `X` and immediately after height `Y`, where `X > Y`. `A` will be trying to catch up to 2000 indefinitely. This condition requires the introduction of malicious code in the full node first reporting some non-existing `latest` height, then reporting lower `latest` height and nodes which are syncing using `blocksync` protocol.

There might be Kubernetes namespaced resources that should not be validated by AdmissionPolicy and by the AdmissionPolicyGroup policies because of their sensitive nature. For example, PolicyReport are namespaced resources that contain the list of non compliant objects found inside of a namespace.

CVE-2025-24783,"** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) vulnerability in Apache Cocoon.

This issue affects Apache Cocoon: all versions.

When a continuation is created, it gets a random identifier. Because the random number generator used to generate these identifiers was seeded with the startup time, it may not have been sufficiently unpredictable, and an attacker could use this to guess continuation ids and look up continuations they should not have had access to.

As a mitigation, you may enable the ""session-bound-continuations"" option to make sure continuations are not shared across sessions.


As this project is retired, we do not plan to release a version that fixes this issue. Users are recommended to find an alternative or restrict access to the instance to trusted users.

NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.",,,
CVE-2025-24784,"kubewarden-controller is a Kubernetes controller that allows you to dynamically register Kubewarden admission policies. The policy group feature, added to by the 1.17.0 release. By being namespaced, the AdmissionPolicyGroup has a well constrained impact on cluster resources. Hence, it’s considered safe to allow non-admin users to create and manage these resources in the namespaces they own. Kubewarden policies can be allowed to query the Kubernetes API at evaluation time; these types of policies are called “context aware“. Context aware policies can perform list and get operations against a Kubernetes cluster. The queries are done using the ServiceAccount of the Policy Server instance that hosts the policy. That means that access to the cluster is determined by the RBAC rules that apply to that ServiceAccount. The AdmissionPolicyGroup CRD allowed the deployment of context aware policies. This could allow an attacker to obtain information about resources that are out of their reach, by leveraging a higher access to the cluster granted to the ServiceAccount token used to run the policy. The impact of this vulnerability depends on the privileges that have been granted to the ServiceAccount used to run the Policy Server and assumes that users are using the recommended best practices of keeping the Policy Server's ServiceAccount least privileged. By default, the Kubewarden helm chart grants access to the following resources (cluster wide) only: Namespace, Pod, Deployment and Ingress. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.21.0.",,,
CVE-2025-24786,"WhoDB is an open source database management tool. While the application only displays Sqlite3 databases present in the directory `/db`, there is no path traversal prevention in place. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to open any Sqlite3 database present on the host machine that the application is running on. Affected versions of WhoDB allow users to connect to Sqlite3 databases. By default, the databases must be present in `/db/` (or alternatively `./tmp/` if development mode is enabled).  If no databases are present in the default directory, the UI indicates that the user is unable to open any databases. The database file is an user-controlled value. This value is used in `.Join()` with the default directory, in order to get the full path of the database file to open. No checks are performed whether the database file that is eventually opened actually resides in the default directory `/db`. This allows an attacker to use path traversal (`../../`) in order to open any Sqlite3 database present on the system. This issue has been addressed in version 0.45.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",,,
CVE-2025-24787,"WhoDB is an open source database management tool. In affected versions the application is vulnerable to parameter injection in database connection strings, which allows an attacker to read local files on the machine the application is running on. The application uses string concatenation to build database connection URIs which are then passed to corresponding libraries responsible for setting up the database connections. This string concatenation is done unsafely and without escaping or encoding the user input. This allows an user, in many cases, to inject arbitrary parameters into the URI string. These parameters can be potentially dangerous depending on the libraries used. One of these dangerous parameters is `allowAllFiles` in the library `github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql`. Should this be set to `true`, the library enables running the `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` query on any file on the host machine (in this case, the machine that WhoDB is running on). By injecting `&allowAllFiles=true` into the connection URI and connecting to any MySQL server (such as an attacker-controlled one), the attacker is able to read local files. This issue has been addressed in version 0.45.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",,,

CVE-2025-24806,"Authelia is an open-source authentication and authorization server providing two-factor authentication and single sign-on (SSO) for applications via a web portal. If users are allowed to sign in via both username and email the regulation system treats these as separate login events. This leads to the regulation limitations being effectively doubled assuming an attacker using brute-force to find a user password. It's important to note that due to the effective operation of regulation where no user-facing sign of their regulation ban being visible either via timing or via API responses, it's effectively impossible to determine if a failure occurs due to a bad username password combination, or a effective ban blocking the attempt which heavily mitigates any form of brute-force. This occurs because the records and counting process for this system uses the method utilized for sign in rather than the effective username attribute. This has a minimal impact on account security, this impact is increased naturally in scenarios when there is no two-factor authentication required and weak passwords are used. This makes it a bit easier to brute-force a password. A patch for this issue has been applied to versions 4.38.19, and 4.39.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should 1. Not heavily modify the default settings in a way that ends up with shorter or less frequent regulation bans.

CVE-2025-24814,"Core creation allows users to replace ""trusted"" configset files with arbitrary configuration

Solr instances that (1) use the ""FileSystemConfigSetService"" component (the default in ""standalone"" or ""user-managed"" mode), and (2) are running without authentication and authorization are vulnerable to a sort of privilege escalation wherein individual ""trusted"" configset files can be ignored in favor of potentially-untrusted replacements available elsewhere on the filesystem.  These replacement config files are treated as ""trusted"" and can use ""<lib>"" tags to add to Solr's classpath, which an attacker might use to load malicious code as a searchComponent or other plugin.

This issue affects all Apache Solr versions up through Solr 9.7.  Users can protect against the vulnerability by enabling authentication and authorization on their Solr clusters or switching to SolrCloud (and away from ""FileSystemConfigSetService"").  Users are also recommended to upgrade to Solr 9.8.0, which mitigates this issue by disabling use of ""<lib>"" tags by default.",,,

CVE-2025-24888,"The SecureDrop Client is a desktop application for journalists to communicate with sources and work with submissions on the SecureDrop Workstation. Prior to version 0.14.1, a malicious SecureDrop Server could obtain code execution on the SecureDrop Client virtual machine (`sd-app`). SecureDrop Server itself has multiple layers of built-in hardening, and is a dedicated physical machine exposed on the internet only via Tor hidden services for the Source and Journalist interfaces, and optionally via remote SSH access over another Tor hidden service. A newsroom's SecureDrop Workstation communicates only with its own dedicated SecureDrop Server.

The SecureDrop Client runs in a dedicated Qubes virtual machine, named `sd-app`, as part of the SecureDrop Workstation. The private OpenPGP key used to decrypt submissions and replies is stored in a separate virtual machine and never accessed directly. The vulnerability lies in the code responsible for downloading replies. The filename of the reply is obtained from the `Content-Disposition` HTTP header and used to write the encrypted reply on disk. Note that filenames are generated and sanitized server-side, and files are downloaded in an encrypted format, so a remote attacker who has not achieved server compromise, such as one posing as a source, could not craft the HTTP response necessary for this attack.

While the filename is later checked to guard against path traversal before being moved into the Client’s data storage directory, the file has already been written to a potentially arbitrary location. In this case, `safe_move()` would detect the path traversal and fail, leaving the original downloaded file in the attacker-chosen directory. Code execution can be gained by writing an autostart file in `/home/user/.config/autostart/`.

Version 0.14.1 fixes the issue. As of time of publication, there is no known evidence of exploitation in the wild. This attack requires a previously compromised SecureDrop Server.",,,
CVE-2025-24889,"The SecureDrop Client is a desktop application for journalists to communicate with sources and work with submissions on the SecureDrop Workstation. Prior to versions 0.14.1 and 1.0.1, an attacker who has already gained code execution in a virtual machine on the SecureDrop Workstation could gain code execution in the `sd-log` virtual machine by sending a specially crafted log entry. The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely and requires an attacker to already have code execution on one of the other virtual machines (VMs) of the system. Due to the Workstation's underlying usage of Qubes for strong isolation, the vulnerability would have allowed lateral movement between any log-enabled VM and the `sd-log` VM, but no further. The SecureDrop workstation collects logs centrally in an isolated virtual machine named `sd-log` for easy export for support and debugging purposes. The `sd-log`  VM is completely isolated from the internet and ingests logs via a narrow Qubes RPC policy that allows for specific inter-VM communication via the Xen vchan protocol used by Qubes's qrexec mechanism. A path traversal bug was found in the logic used to choose where to write the log file for a specific VM: the VM name, used unsanitized in the destination path in `sd-log`, is supplied by the logging VM itself instead of being read from a trusted source, such as the Qubes environment variable `QREXEC_REMOTE_DOMAIN` that is used in the fixed implementation. An attacker could provide an arbitrary source VM name, possibly overwriting logs of other VMs, or writing a file named `syslog.log`, with attacker-controlled content, in arbitrary directories as a low-privileged user. A successful attack could potentially overwrite or add configuration to software that loads configuration files from a directory. This is exploitable to achieve code execution by setting the target directory to `/home/user/.config/autostart/` and letting it write `syslog.log`, because XFCE treats any file in that directory as a `.desktop` file regardless of its extension. Versions 0.14.1 and 1.0.1 contain a patch for this issue.",,,

CVE-2025-24976,"Distribution is a toolkit to pack, ship, store, and deliver container content. Systems running registry versions 3.0.0-beta.1 through 3.0.0-rc.2 with token authentication enabled may be vulnerable to an issue in which token authentication allows an attacker to inject an untrusted signing key in a JSON web token (JWT). The issue lies in how the JSON web key (JWK) verification is performed. When a JWT contains a JWK header without a certificate chain, the code only checks if the KeyID (`kid`) matches one of the trusted keys, but doesn't verify that the actual key material matches. A fix for the issue is available at commit 5ea9aa028db65ca5665f6af2c20ecf9dc34e5fcd and expected to be a part of version 3.0.0-rc.3.

CVE-2025-24981,MDC is a tool to take regular Markdown and write documents interacting deeply with a Vue component. In affected versions unsafe parsing logic of the URL from markdown can lead to arbitrary JavaScript code due to a bypass to the existing guards around the `javascript:` protocol scheme in the URL. The parsing logic implement in `props.ts` maintains a deny-list approach to filtering potential malicious payload. It does so by matching protocol schemes like `javascript:` and others. These security guards can be bypassed by an adversarial that provides JavaScript URLs with HTML entities encoded via hex string. Users who consume this library and perform markdown parsing from unvalidated sources could result in rendering vulnerable XSS anchor links. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 0.13.3 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,,,

CVE-2025-25183,"vLLM is a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs. Maliciously constructed statements can lead to hash collisions, resulting in cache reuse, which can interfere with subsequent responses and cause unintended behavior. Prefix caching makes use of Python's built-in hash() function. As of Python 3.12, the behavior of hash(None) has changed to be a predictable constant value. This makes it more feasible that someone could try exploit hash collisions. The impact of a collision would be using cache that was generated using different content. Given knowledge of prompts in use and predictable hashing behavior, someone could intentionally populate the cache using a prompt known to collide with another prompt in use. This issue has been addressed in version 0.7.2 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",,,
CVE-2025-25184,"Rack provides an interface for developing web applications in Ruby. Prior to versions 2.2.11, 3.0.12, and 3.1.10, Rack::CommonLogger can be exploited by crafting input that includes newline characters to manipulate log entries. The supplied proof-of-concept demonstrates injecting malicious content into logs. When a user provides the authorization credentials via Rack::Auth::Basic, if success, the username will be put in env['REMOTE_USER'] and later be used by Rack::CommonLogger for logging purposes. The issue occurs when a server intentionally or unintentionally allows a user creation with the username contain CRLF and white space characters, or the server just want to log every login attempts. If an attacker enters a username with CRLF character, the logger will log the malicious username with CRLF characters into the logfile. Attackers can break log formats or insert fraudulent entries, potentially obscuring real activity or injecting malicious data into log files. Versions 2.2.11, 3.0.12, and 3.1.10 contain a fix.",,,

A vulnerability present starting in version 0.8.0 and prior to versions 0.24.3 and 0.25.0-alpha.5 impacts Hickory DNS users relying on DNSSEC verification in the client library, stub resolver, or recursive resolver. The DNSSEC validation routines treat entire RRsets of DNSKEY records as trusted once they have established trust in only one of the DNSKEYs. As a result, if a zone includes a DNSKEY with a public key that matches a configured trust anchor, all keys in that zone will be trusted to authenticate other records in the zone. There is a second variant of this vulnerability involving DS records, where an authenticated DS record covering one DNSKEY leads to trust in signatures made by an unrelated DNSKEY in the same zone.

The vulnerability exists because the EchoProcess service directly reflects user input in its output without proper sanitization when handling complex inputs.The service accepts various input formats including XML, JSON, and SVG, and returns the content based on the requested MIME type. When processing SVG content and returning it with the image/svg+xml MIME type, the server fails to sanitize potentially malicious JavaScript in attributes like onload, allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution in the victim's browser context. This vulnerability is particularly dangerous because it exists in a service specifically designed to echo back user input, and the lack of proper sanitization in combination with SVG handling creates a reliable XSS vector.

Unless one hase implemented any kind of custom token revocation feature in your application, then one will not be affected. The impact here for users using builtin functionality is that magic link tokens are reusable until they expire. With that said, magic link tokens are only valid for 10 minutes, so the surface area for abuse is extremely low here. The flaw is patched in version 4.4.9. Additionally a compile time warning is shown to users with remediation instructions if they upgrade. 4.4.9 ships with an upgrader, so those who use `mix igniter.upgrade ash_authentication` will have the necessary patch applied. Otherwise, one may run the upgrader manually as described in the error message. As a workaround, delete the generated `:revoked?` generic action in the token resource.

CVE-2025-25284,"The ZOO-Project is an open source processing platform, released under MIT/X11 Licence. A vulnerability in ZOO-Project's WPS (Web Processing Service) implementation allows unauthorized access to files outside the intended directory through path traversal. Specifically, the Gdal_Translate service, when processing VRT (Virtual Format) files, does not properly validate file paths referenced in the VRTRasterBand element, allowing attackers to read arbitrary files on the system. The vulnerability exists because the service doesn't properly sanitize the SourceFilename parameter in VRT files, allowing relative path traversal sequences (../). When combined with VRT's raw data handling capabilities, this allows reading arbitrary files as raw binary data and converting them to TIFF format, effectively exposing their contents. This vulnerability is particularly severe because it allows attackers to read sensitive system files, potentially exposing configuration data, credentials, or other confidential information stored on the server. An unauthenticated attacker can read arbitrary files from the system through path traversal, potentially accessing sensitive information such as configuration files, credentials, or other confidential data stored on the server. The vulnerability requires no authentication and can be exploited remotely through the WPS service. This issue has been addressed in commit `5f155a8` and all users are advised to upgrade.

CVE-2025-25295,"Label Studio is an open source data labeling tool. A path traversal vulnerability in Label Studio SDK versions prior to 1.0.10 allows unauthorized file access outside the intended directory structure.

These functions invoke a `download` function on the `label-studio-sdk` python package, which fails to validate file paths when processing image references during task exports. By creating tasks with path traversal sequences in the image field, an attacker can force the application to read files from arbitrary server filesystem locations when exporting projects in any of the mentioned formats. This is authentication-required vulnerability allowing arbitrary file reads from the server filesystem. It may lead to potential exposure of sensitive information like configuration files, credentials, and confidential data. Label Studio versions before 1.16.0 specified SDK versions prior to 1.0.10 as dependencies, and the issue was confirmed in Label Studio version 1.13.2.dev0; therefore, Label Studio users should upgrade to 1.16.0 or newer to mitigate it.",,,
CVE-2025-25296,"Label Studio is an open source data labeling tool. Prior to version 1.16.0, Label Studio's `/projects/upload-example` endpoint allows injection of arbitrary HTML through a `GET` request with an appropriately crafted `label_config` query parameter. By crafting a specially formatted XML label config with inline task data containing malicious HTML/JavaScript, an attacker can achieve Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). While the application has a Content Security Policy (CSP), it is only set in report-only mode, making it ineffective at preventing script execution. The vulnerability exists because the upload-example endpoint renders user-provided HTML content without proper sanitization on a GET request. This allows attackers to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript in victims' browsers by getting them to visit a maliciously crafted URL. This is considered vulnerable because it enables attackers to execute JavaScript in victims' contexts, potentially allowing theft of sensitive data, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.

CVE-2025-25297,"Label Studio is an open source data labeling tool. Prior to version 1.16.0, Label Studio's S3 storage integration feature contains a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in its endpoint configuration. When creating an S3 storage connection, the application allows users to specify a custom S3 endpoint URL via the s3_endpoint parameter. This endpoint URL is passed directly to the boto3 AWS SDK without proper validation or restrictions on the protocol or destination. The vulnerability allows an attacker to make the application send HTTP requests to arbitrary internal services by specifying them as the S3 endpoint. When the storage sync operation is triggered, the application attempts to make S3 API calls to the specified endpoint, effectively making HTTP requests to the target service and returning the response in error messages. This SSRF vulnerability enables attackers to bypass network segmentation and access internal services that should not be accessible from the external network. The vulnerability is particularly severe because error messages from failed requests contain the full response body, allowing data exfiltration from internal services. Version 1.16.0 contains a patch for the issue.",,,

CVE-2025-25305,"Home Assistant Core is an open source home automation that puts local control and privacy first. Affected versions are subject to a potential man-in-the-middle attacks due to missing SSL certificate verification in the project codebase and used third-party libraries. In the past, `aiohttp-session`/`request` had the parameter `verify_ssl` to control SSL certificate verification. This was a boolean value. In `aiohttp` 3.0, this parameter was deprecated in favor of the `ssl` parameter. Only when `ssl` is set to `None` or provided with a correct configured SSL context the standard SSL certificate verification will happen. When migrating integrations in Home Assistant and libraries used by Home Assistant, in some cases the `verify_ssl` parameter value was just moved to the new `ssl` parameter. This resulted in these integrations and 3rd party libraries using `request.ssl = True`, which unintentionally turned off SSL certificate verification and opened up a man-in-the-middle attack vector.

The problem occurs because these add-ons accept any password entered by the user and do not have an additional authentication or computer verification mechanism. Tests indicate that more than 1,000 systems use easy-to-guess passwords, many with less than 4 to 6 characters, including common sequences. This allows brute force attacks or trial-and-error attempts by malicious invaders. The vulnerability can be exploited by a remote attacker who knows or can guess the password used in the connection.

CVE-2025-26603,"Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi. Vim allows to redirect screen messages using the `:redir` ex command to register, variables and files. It also allows to show the contents of registers using the `:registers` or `:display` ex command. When redirecting the output of `:display` to a register, Vim will free the register content before storing the new content in the register. Now when redirecting the `:display` command to a register that is being displayed, Vim will free the content while shortly afterwards trying to access it, which leads to a use-after-free. Vim pre 9.1.1115 checks in the ex_display() function, that it does not try to redirect to a register while displaying this register at the same time. However this check is not complete, and so Vim does not check the `+` and `*` registers (which typically donate the X11/clipboard registers, and when a clipboard connection is not possible will fall back to use register 0 instead. In Patch 9.1.1115 Vim will therefore skip outputting to register zero when trying to redirect to the clipboard registers `*` or `+`. Users are advised to upgrade.

CVE-2025-26618,"Erlang is a programming language and runtime system for building massively scalable soft real-time systems with requirements on high availability. OTP is a set of Erlang libraries, which consists of the Erlang runtime system, a number of ready-to-use components mainly written in Erlang. Packet size is not verified properly for SFTP packets. As a result when multiple SSH packets (conforming to max SSH packet size) are received by ssh, they might be combined into an SFTP packet which will exceed the max allowed packet size and potentially cause large amount of memory to be allocated. Note that situation described above can only happen for successfully authenticated users after completing the SSH handshake. This issue has been patched in OTP versions 27.2.4, 26.2.5.9, and 25.3.2.18. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",,,

CVE-2025-26620,"Duende.AccessTokenManagement is a set of .NET libraries that manage OAuth and OpenId Connect access tokens. Duende.AccessTokenManagement contains a race condition when requesting access tokens using the client credentials flow. Concurrent requests to obtain an access token using differing protocol parameters can return access tokens obtained with the wrong scope, resource indicator, or other protocol parameters. Such usage is somewhat atypical, and only a small percentage of users are likely to be affected. Duende.AccessTokenManagement can request access tokens using the client credentials flow in several ways. In basic usage, the client credentials flow is configured once and the parameters do not vary. In more advanced situations, requests with varying protocol parameters may be made by calling specific overloads of these methods: `HttpContext.GetClientAccessTokenAsync()` and `IClientCredentialsTokenManagementService.GetAccessTokenAsync()`. There are overloads of both of these methods that accept a `TokenRequestParameters` object that customizes token request parameters. However, concurrent requests with varying `TokenRequestParameters` will result in the same token for all concurrent calls. Most users can simply update the NuGet package to the latest version. Customizations of the `IClientCredentialsTokenCache` that derive from the default implementation (`DistributedClientCredentialsTokenCache`) will require a small code change, as its constructor was changed to add a dependency on the `ITokenRequestSynchronization` service. The synchronization service will need to be injected into the derived class and passed to the base constructor. The impact of this vulnerability depends on how Duende.AccessTokenManagement is used and on the security architecture of the solution. Most users will not be vulnerable to this issue. More advanced users may run into this issue by calling the methods specified above with customized token request parameters. The impact of obtaining an access token with different than intended protocol parameters will vary depending on application logic, security architecture, and the authorization policy of the resource servers.",,,

CVE-2025-26623,"Exiv2 is a C++ library and a command-line utility to read, write, delete and modify Exif, IPTC, XMP and ICC image metadata. A heap buffer overflow was found in Exiv2 versions v0.28.0 to v0.28.4. Versions prior to v0.28.0, such as v0.27.7, are **not** affected. Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. The heap overflow is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to gain code execution, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when writing the metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you need to add an extra command-line argument such as `fixiso`. The bug is fixed in version v0.28.5. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",,,

CVE-2025-27088,"oxyno-zeta/s3-proxy is an aws s3 proxy written in go. In affected versions a Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability enables attackers to create malicious URLs that, when visited, inject scripts into the web application. This can lead to session hijacking or phishing attacks on a trusted domain, posing a moderate risk to all users. It's possible to inject html elements, including scripts through the folder-list template. The affected template allows users to interact with the URL path provided by the `Request.URL.Path` variable, which is then rendered directly into the HTML without proper sanitization or escaping. This can be abused by attackers who craft a malicious URL containing injected HTML or JavaScript. When users visit such a URL, the malicious script will be executed in the user's context. This issue has been addressed in version 4.18.1 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",,,
CVE-2025-27089,"Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. In affected versions if there are two overlapping policies for the `update` action that allow access to different fields, instead of correctly checking access permissions against the item they apply for the user is allowed to update the superset of fields allowed by any of the policies. E.g. have one policy allowing update access to `field_a` if the `id == 1` and one policy allowing update access to `field_b` if the `id == 2`. The user with both these policies is allowed to update both `field_a` and `field_b` for the items with ids `1` and `2`. Before v11, if a user was allowed to update an item they were allowed to update the fields that the single permission, that applied to that item, listed. With overlapping permissions this isn't as clear cut anymore and the union of fields might not be the fields the user is allowed to update for that specific item. The solution that this PR introduces is to evaluate the permissions for each field that the user tries to update in the validateItemAccess DB query, instead of only verifying access to the item as a whole. This is done by, instead of returning the actual field value, returning a flag that indicates if the user has access to that field. This uses the same case/when mechanism that is used for stripping out non permitted field that is at the core of the permissions engine. As a result, for every item that the access is validated for, the expected result is an item that has either 1 or null for all the ""requested"" fields instead of any of the actual field values. These results are not useful for anything other than verifying the field level access permissions. The final check in validateItemAccess can either fail if the number of items does not match the number of items the access is checked for (ie. the user does not have access to the item at all) or if not all of the passed in fields have access permissions for any of the returned items. This is a vulnerability that allows update access to unintended fields, potentially impacting the password field for user accounts. This has been addressed in version 11.1.2 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",,4.3,CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N

CVE-2025-27091,"OpenH264 is a free license codec library which supports H.264 encoding and decoding. A vulnerability in the decoding functions of OpenH264 codec library could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to trigger a heap overflow. This vulnerability is due to a race condition between a Sequence Parameter Set (SPS) memory allocation and a subsequent non Instantaneous Decoder Refresh (non-IDR) Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) unit memory usage. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious bitstream and tricking a victim user into processing an arbitrary video containing the malicious bistream. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected crash in the victim's user decoding client and, possibly, perform arbitrary commands on the victim's host by abusing the heap overflow. This vulnerability affects OpenH264 2.5.0 and earlier releases. Both Scalable Video Coding (SVC) mode and Advanced Video Coding (AVC) mode are affected by this vulnerability.

CVE-2025-27092,"GHOSTS is an open source user simulation framework for cyber experimentation, simulation, training, and exercise. A path traversal vulnerability was discovered in GHOSTS version 8.0.0.0 that allows an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory through the photo retrieval endpoint. The vulnerability exists in the /api/npcs/{id}/photo endpoint, which is designed to serve profile photos for NPCs (Non-Player Characters) but fails to properly validate and sanitize file paths. When an NPC is created with a specially crafted photoLink value containing path traversal sequences (../, ..\, etc.), the application processes these sequences without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to traverse directory structures and access files outside of the intended photo directory, potentially exposing sensitive system files. The vulnerability is particularly severe because it allows reading arbitrary files from the server's filesystem with the permissions of the web application process, which could include configuration files, credentials, or other sensitive data. This issue has been addressed in version 8.2.7.90 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",,7.5,CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

CVE-2025-27104,"vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the EVM. Multiple evaluation of a single expression is possible in the iterator target of a for loop. While the iterator expression cannot produce multiple writes, it can consume side effects produced in the loop body (e.g. read a storage variable updated in the loop body) and thus lead to unexpected program behavior. Specifically, reads in iterators which contain an ifexp (e.g. `for s: uint256 in ([read(), read()] if True else [])`) may interleave reads with writes in the loop body. Vyper for loops allow two kinds of iterator targets, namely the `range()` builtin and an iterable type, like SArray and DArray. During codegen, iterable lists are required to not produce any side-effects (in the following code, `range_scope` forces `iter_list` to be parsed in a constant context, which is checked against `is_constant`). However, this does not prevent the iterator from consuming side effects provided by the body of the loop. For SArrays on the other hand, `iter_list` is instantiated in the body of a `repeat` ir, so it can be evaluated several times. This issue is being addressed and is expected to be available in version 0.4.1. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as the patched release is available.

Minecraft users who use Integrated Scripting prior to versions 1.21.1-1.0.17, 1.21.4-1.0.9-254, 1.20.1-1.0.13, and 1.19.2-1.0.10 may be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution. By using Java reflection on a thrown exception object it's possible to escape the JavaScript sandbox for IntegratedScripting's Variable Cards, and leverage that to construct arbitrary Java classes and invoke arbitrary Java methods.
This vulnerability allows for execution of arbitrary Java methods, and by extension arbitrary native code e.g. from `java.lang.Runtime.exec`, on the Minecraft server by any player with the ability to create and use an IntegratedScripting Variable Card.

CVE-2025-27108,"dom-expressions is a Fine-Grained Runtime for Performant DOM Rendering. In affected versions the use of javascript's `.replace()` opens up to potential Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities with the special replacement patterns beginning with `$`. Particularly, when the attributes of `Meta` tag from solid-meta are user-defined, attackers can utilise the special replacement patterns, either `$'` or `$\`` to achieve XSS. The solid-meta package has this issue since it uses `useAffect` and context providers, which injects the used assets in the html header. ""dom-expressions"" uses `.replace()` to insert the assets, which is vulnerable to the special replacement patterns listed above.  This effectively means that if the attributes of an asset tag contained user-controlled data, it would be vulnerable to XSS. For instance, there might be meta tags for the open graph protocol in a user profile page, but if attackers set the user query to some payload abusing `.replace()`, then they could execute arbitrary javascript in the victim's web browser. Moreover, it could be stored and cause more problems. This issue has been addressed in version 0.39.5 and all users are advised to upgrade.

CVE-2025-27136,"LocalS3 is an Amazon S3 mock service for testing and local development. Prior to version 1.21, the LocalS3 service's bucket creation endpoint is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection. When processing the CreateBucketConfiguration XML document during bucket creation, the service's XML parser is configured to resolve external entities. This allows an attacker to declare an external entity that references an internal URL, which the server will then attempt to fetch when parsing the XML. The vulnerability specifically occurs in the location constraint processing, where the XML parser resolves external entities without proper validation or restrictions. When the external entity is resolved, the server makes an HTTP request to the specified URL and includes the response content in the parsed XML document. This vulnerability can be exploited to perform server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks, allowing an attacker to make requests to internal services or resources that should not be accessible from external networks. The server will include the responses from these internal requests in the resulting bucket configuration, effectively leaking sensitive information. The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the LocalS3 service to exploit this vulnerability.",,,
CVE-2025-27137,"Dependency-Track is a component analysis platform that allows organizations to identify and reduce risk in the software supply chain. Dependency-Track allows users with the `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission to customize notification templates. Templates are evaluated using the Pebble template engine. Pebble supports an `include` tag, which allows template authors to include the content of arbitrary files upon evaluation. Prior to version 4.12.6, users of Dependency-Track with the `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission can abuse the `include` tag by crafting notification templates that `include` sensitive local files, such as `/etc/passwd` or `/proc/1/environ`. By configuring such a template for a notification rule (aka ""Alert""), and having it send notifications to a destination controlled by the actor, sensitive information may be leaked. The issue has been fixed in Dependency-Track 4.12.6. In fixed versions, the `include` tag can no longer be used. Usage of the tag will cause template evaluation to fail.

CVE-2025-27148,"Gradle is a build automation tool, and its native-platform tool provides Java bindings for native APIs. On Unix-like systems, the system temporary directory can be created with open permissions that allow multiple users to create and delete files within it. This library initialization could be vulnerable to a local privilege escalation from an attacker quickly deleting and recreating files in the system temporary directory. Gradle builds that rely on versions of net.rubygrapefruit:native-platform prior to 0.22-milestone-28 could be vulnerable to a local privilege escalation from an attacker quickly deleting and recreating files in the system temporary directory.

In net.rubygrapefruit:native-platform prior to version 0.22-milestone-28, if the `Native.get(Class<>)` method was called, without calling `Native.init(File)` first, with a non-`null` argument used as working file path, then the library would initialize itself using the system temporary directory and NativeLibraryLocator.java lines 68 through 78. Version 0.22-milestone-28 has been released with changes that fix the problem. Initialization is now mandatory and no longer uses the system temporary directory, unless such a path is passed for initialization. The only workaround for affected versions is to make sure to do a proper initialization, using a location that is safe.

Gradle 8.12, only that exact version, had codepaths where the initialization of the underlying native integration library took a default path, relying on copying the binaries to the system temporary directory. Any execution of Gradle exposed this exploit. Users of Windows or modern versions of macOS are not vulnerable, nor are users of a Unix-like operating system with the ""sticky"" bit set or `noexec` on their system temporary directory vulnerable. This problem was fixed in Gradle 8.12.1. Gradle 8.13 release also upgrades to a version of the native library that no longer has that bug. Some workarounds are available. On Unix-like operating systems, ensure that the ""sticky"" bit is set. This only allows the original user (or root) to delete a file. Mounting `/tmp` as `noexec` will prevent Gradle 8.12 from starting. Those who are are unable to change the permissions of the system temporary directory can move the Java temporary directory by setting the System Property java.io.tmpdir. The new path needs to limit permissions to the build user only.",,,

CVE-2025-27403,"Ratify is a verification engine as a binary executable and on Kubernetes which enables verification of artifact security metadata and admits for deployment only those that comply with policies the user creates. In a Kubernetes environment, Ratify can be configured to authenticate to a private Azure Container Registry (ACR). The Azure workload identity and Azure managed identity authentication providers are configured in this setup. Users that configure a private ACR to be used with the Azure authentication providers may be impacted by a vulnerability that exists in versions prior to 1.2.3 and 1.3.2. Both Azure authentication providers attempt to exchange an Entra ID (EID) token for an ACR refresh token. However, Ratify’s Azure authentication providers did not verify that the target registry is an ACR. This could have led to the EID token being presented to a non-ACR registry during token exchange. EID tokens with ACR access can potentially be extracted and abused if a user workload contains an image reference to a malicious registry. As of versions 1.2.3 and 1.3.2, the Azure workload identity and Azure managed identity authentication providers are updated to add new validation prior to EID token exchange. Validation relies upon registry domain validation against a pre-configured list of well-known ACR endpoints. EID token exchange will be executed only if at least one of the configured well-known domain suffixes (wildcard support included) matches the registry domain of the image reference.",,,

CVE-2025-27414,"MinIO is a high performance object storage. Starting in RELEASE.2024-06-06T09-36-42Z and prior to 
RELEASE.2025-02-28T09-55-16Z, a bug in evaluating the trust of the SSH key used in an SFTP connection to MinIO allows authentication bypass and unauthorized data access. On a MinIO server with SFTP access configured and using LDAP as an external identity provider, MinIO supports SSH key based authentication for SFTP connections when the user has the `sshPublicKey` attribute set in their LDAP server. The server trusts the client's key only when the public key is the same as the `sshPublicKey` attribute. Due to the bug, when the user has no `sshPublicKey` property in LDAP, the server ends up trusting the key allowing the client to perform any FTP operations allowed by the MinIO access policies associated with the LDAP user (or any of their groups). Three requirements must be met in order to exploit the vulnerability. First, the MinIO server must be configured to allow SFTP access and use LDAP as an external identity provider. Second, the attacker must have knowledge of an LDAP username that does not have the `sshPublicKey` property set. Third, such an LDAP username or one of their groups must also have some MinIO access policy configured. When this bug is successfully exploited, the attacker can perform any FTP operations (i.e. reading, writing, deleting and listing objects) allowed by the access policy associated with the LDAP user account (and their groups).

CVE-2025-27512,"Zincati is an auto-update agent for Fedora CoreOS hosts. Zincati ships a polkit rule which allows the `zincati` system user to use the actions `org.projectatomic.rpmostree1.deploy` to deploy updates to the system and `org.projectatomic.rpmostree1.finalize-deployment` to reboot the system into the deployed update. Since Zincati v0.0.24, this polkit rule contains a logic error which broadens access of those polkit actions to any unprivileged user rather than just the `zincati` system user. In practice, this means that any unprivileged user with access to the system D-Bus socket is able to deploy older Fedora CoreOS versions (which may have other known vulnerabilities). Note that rpm-ostree enforces that the selected version must be from the same branch the system is currently on so this cannot directly be used to deploy an attacker-controlled update payload. This primarily impacts users running untrusted workloads with access to the system D-Bus socket. Note that in general, untrusted workloads should not be given this access, whether containerized or not. By default, containers do not have access to the system D-Bus socket. The logic error is fixed in Zincati v0.0.30. A workaround is to manually add a following polkit rule, instructions for which are available in the GitHub Security Advisory.",,,

CVE-2025-27636,"Bypass/Injection vulnerability in Apache Camel components under particular conditions.

This issue affects Apache Camel: from 4.10.0 through <= 4.10.1, from 4.8.0 through <= 4.8.4, from 3.10.0 through <= 3.22.3.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.10.2 for 4.10.x LTS, 4.8.5 for 4.8.x LTS and 3.22.4 for 3.x releases.



This vulnerability is present in Camel's default incoming header filter, that allows an attacker to include Camel specific

headers that for some Camel components can alter the behaviours such as the camel-bean component, to call another method

on the bean, than was coded in the application. In the camel-jms component, then a malicious header can be used to send

the message to another queue (on the same broker) than was coded in the application. This could also be seen by using the camel-exec component




The attacker would need to inject custom headers, such as HTTP protocols. So if you have Camel applications that are

directly connected to the internet via HTTP, then an attacker could include malicious HTTP headers in the HTTP requests

that are send to the Camel application.




All the known Camel HTTP component such as camel-servlet, camel-jetty, camel-undertow, camel-platform-http, and camel-netty-http would be vulnerable out of the box.

In these conditions an attacker could be able to forge a Camel header name and make the bean component invoking other methods in the same bean.

In terms of usage of the default header filter strategy the list of components using that is: 


  *  camel-activemq
  *  camel-activemq6
  *  camel-amqp
  *  camel-aws2-sqs
  *  camel-azure-servicebus
  *  camel-cxf-rest
  *  camel-cxf-soap
  *  camel-http
  *  camel-jetty
  *  camel-jms
  *  camel-kafka
  *  camel-knative
  *  camel-mail
  *  camel-nats
  *  camel-netty-http
  *  camel-platform-http
  *  camel-rest
  *  camel-sjms
  *  camel-spring-rabbitmq
  *  camel-stomp
  *  camel-tahu
  *  camel-undertow
  *  camel-xmpp






The vulnerability arises due to a bug in the default filtering mechanism that only blocks headers starting with ""Camel"", ""camel"", or ""org.apache.camel."". 


Mitigation: You can easily work around this in your Camel applications by removing the headers in your Camel routes. There are many ways of doing this, also globally or per route. This means you could use the removeHeaders EIP, to filter out anything like ""cAmel, cAMEL"" etc, or in general everything not starting with ""Camel"", ""camel"" or ""org.apache.camel."".",,,

A session hijacking vulnerability exists in versions prior to 1.8.10 when an attacker-controlled authoritative subdomain under a parent domain (e.g., `subdomain.host.com`) sets cookies scoped to the parent domain (`.host.com`). This allows session token replacement for applications hosted on sibling subdomains (e.g., `community.host.com`) if session tokens aren't rotated post-authentication. Key Constraints are that the attacker must control any subdomain under the parent domain (e.g., `evil.host.com` or `x.y.host.com`), and the parent domain must not be on the Public Suffix List. Due to non-existent session token rotation after authenticating we can theoretically reproduce the vulnerability by using browser dev tools, but due to the browser's security measures this does not seem to be exploitable as described.

CVE-2025-29770,"vLLM is a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs. The outlines library is one of the backends used by vLLM to support structured output (a.k.a. guided decoding). Outlines provides an optional cache for its compiled grammars on the local filesystem. This cache has been on by default in vLLM. Outlines is also available by default through the OpenAI compatible API server. The affected code in vLLM is vllm/model_executor/guided_decoding/outlines_logits_processors.py, which unconditionally uses the cache from outlines. A malicious user can send a stream of very short decoding requests with unique schemas, resulting in an addition to the cache for each request. This can result in a Denial of Service if the filesystem runs out of space. Note that even if vLLM was configured to use a different backend by default, it is still possible to choose outlines on a per-request basis using the guided_decoding_backend key of the extra_body field of the request.

CVE-2025-29779,"Post-Quantum Secure Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing provides a Python implementation of Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) scheme. In versions 0.8.0b2 and prior, the `secure_redundant_execution` function in feldman_vss.py attempts to mitigate fault injection attacks by executing a function multiple times and comparing results. However, several critical weaknesses exist. Python's execution environment cannot guarantee true isolation between redundant executions, the constant-time comparison implementation in Python is subject to timing variations, the randomized execution order and timing provide insufficient protection against sophisticated fault attacks, and the error handling may leak timing information about partial execution results. These limitations make the protection ineffective against targeted fault injection attacks, especially from attackers with physical access to the hardware. A successful fault injection attack could allow an attacker to bypass the redundancy check mechanisms, extract secret polynomial coefficients during share generation or verification, force the acceptance of invalid shares during verification, and/or manipulate the commitment verification process to accept fraudulent commitments. This undermines the core security guarantees of the Verifiable Secret Sharing scheme. As of time of publication, no patched versions of Post-Quantum Secure Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing exist, but other mitigations are available. Long-term remediation requires reimplementing the security-critical functions in a lower-level language like Rust. Short-term mitigations include deploying the software in environments with physical security controls, increasing the redundancy count (from 5 to a higher number) by modifying the source code, adding external verification of cryptographic operations when possible, considering using hardware security modules (HSMs) for key operations.",,,
CVE-2025-29780,"Post-Quantum Secure Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing provides a Python implementation of Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) scheme. In versions 0.8.0b2 and prior, the `feldman_vss` library contains timing side-channel vulnerabilities in its matrix operations, specifically within the `_find_secure_pivot` function and potentially other parts of `_secure_matrix_solve`. These vulnerabilities are due to Python's execution model, which does not guarantee constant-time execution. An attacker with the ability to measure the execution time of these functions (e.g., through repeated calls with carefully crafted inputs) could potentially recover secret information used in the Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) scheme. The `_find_secure_pivot` function, used during Gaussian elimination in `_secure_matrix_solve`, attempts to find a non-zero pivot element. However, the conditional statement `if matrix[row][col] != 0 and row_random < min_value:` has execution time that depends on the value of `matrix[row][col]`. This timing difference can be exploited by an attacker. The `constant_time_compare` function in this file also does not provide a constant-time guarantee. The Python implementation of matrix operations in the _find_secure_pivot and _secure_matrix_solve functions cannot guarantee constant-time execution, potentially leaking information about secret polynomial coefficients. An attacker with the ability to make precise timing measurements of these operations could potentially extract secret information through statistical analysis of execution times, though practical exploitation would require significant expertise and controlled execution environments. Successful exploitation of these timing side-channels could allow an attacker to recover secret keys or other sensitive information protected by the VSS scheme. This could lead to a complete compromise of the shared secret. As of time of publication, no patched versions of Post-Quantum Secure Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing exist, but other mitigations are available. As acknowledged in the library's documentation, these vulnerabilities cannot be adequately addressed in pure Python. In the short term, consider using this library only in environments where timing measurements by attackers are infeasible. In the medium term, implement your own wrappers around critical operations using constant-time libraries in languages like Rust, Go, or C. In the long term, wait for the planned Rust implementation mentioned in the library documentation that will properly address these issues.",,,
CVE-2025-29781,"The Bare Metal Operator (BMO) implements a Kubernetes API for managing bare metal hosts in Metal3. Baremetal Operator enables users to load Secret from arbitrary namespaces upon deployment of the namespace scoped Custom Resource `BMCEventSubscription`. Prior to versions 0.8.1 and 0.9.1, an adversary Kubernetes account with only namespace level roles (e.g. a tenant controlling a namespace) may create a `BMCEventSubscription` in his authorized namespace and then load Secrets from his unauthorized namespaces to his authorized namespace via the Baremetal Operator, causing Secret Leakage. The patch makes BMO refuse to read Secrets from other namespace than where the corresponding BMH resource is. The patch does not change the `BMCEventSubscription` API in BMO, but stricter validation will fail the request at admission time. It will also prevent the controller reading such Secrets, in case the BMCES CR has already been deployed. The issue exists for all versions of BMO, and is patched in BMO releases v0.9.1 and v0.8.1. Prior upgrading to patched BMO version, duplicate any existing Secret pointed to by `BMCEventSubscription`'s `httpHeadersRef` to the same namespace where the corresponding BMH exists. After upgrade, remove the old Secrets. As a workaround, the operator can configure BMO RBAC to be namespace scoped, instead of cluster scoped, to prevent BMO from accessing Secrets from other namespaces, and/or use `WATCH_NAMESPACE` configuration option to limit BMO to single namespace.",,,

CVE-2025-29786,"Expr is an expression language and expression evaluation for Go. Prior to version 1.17.0, if the Expr expression parser is given an unbounded input string, it will attempt to compile the entire string and generate an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node for each part of the expression. In scenarios where input size isn’t limited, a malicious or inadvertent extremely large expression can consume excessive memory as the parser builds a huge AST. This can ultimately lead to*excessive memory usage and an Out-Of-Memory (OOM) crash of the process. This issue is relatively uncommon and will only manifest when there are no restrictions on the input size, i.e. the expression length is allowed to grow arbitrarily large. In typical use cases where inputs are bounded or validated, this problem would not occur. The problem has been patched in the latest versions of the Expr library. The fix introduces compile-time limits on the number of AST nodes and memory usage during parsing, preventing any single expression from exhausting resources. Users should upgrade to Expr version 1.17.0 or later, as this release includes the new node budget and memory limit safeguards. Upgrading to v1.17.0 ensures that extremely deep or large expressions are detected and safely aborted during compilation, avoiding the OOM condition. For users who cannot immediately upgrade, the recommended workaround is to impose an input size restriction before parsing. In practice, this means validating or limiting the length of expression strings that your application will accept. For example, set a maximum allowable number of characters (or nodes) for any expression and reject or truncate inputs that exceed this limit. By ensuring no unbounded-length expression is ever fed into the parser, one can prevent the parser from constructing a pathologically large AST and avoid potential memory exhaustion. In short, pre-validate and cap input size as a safeguard in the absence of the patch.",,,

CVE-2025-29891,"Bypass/Injection vulnerability in Apache Camel.

This issue affects Apache Camel: from 4.10.0 before 4.10.2, from 4.8.0 before 4.8.5, from 3.10.0 before 3.22.4.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.10.2 for 4.10.x LTS, 4.8.5 for 4.8.x LTS and 3.22.4 for 3.x releases.

This vulnerability is present in Camel's default incoming header filter, that allows an attacker to include Camel specific headers that for some Camel components can alter the behaviours such as the camel-bean component, or the camel-exec component.

If you have Camel applications that are directly connected to the internet via HTTP, then an attacker could include parameters in the HTTP requests that are sent to the Camel application that get translated into headers. 

The headers could be both provided as request parameters for an HTTP methods invocation or as part of the payload of the HTTP methods invocation.

All the known Camel HTTP component such as camel-servlet, camel-jetty, camel-undertow, camel-platform-http, and camel-netty-http would be vulnerable out of the box.

This CVE is related to the CVE-2025-27636: while they have the same root cause and are fixed with the same fix, CVE-2025-27636 was assumed to only be exploitable if an attacker could add malicious HTTP headers, while we have now determined that it is also exploitable via HTTP parameters.

This impersonation could potentially enable jailbreak attacks when interacting with large language models (LLMs). Just like the Javascript's prototype pollution, this vulnerability could leave a way for attackers to manipulate the intended data-flow or control-flow of the application at runtime and lead to severe consequences like remote code execution when gadgets are available.
