# tools/

This folder contains optional tools and utilities that enhance how VTK outputs can be used, especially for visualization or advanced review.

These are not required for the main pipeline but can significantly improve your analysis workflow.

## pyVIP Visualization

### ðŸ“„ `pyvip_exploit_scatter.py`

Launches a 3D scatter plot of vulnerability match results in [Virtualitics Explore](https://www.virtualitics.com) using the [pyVIP Python API](https://docs.virtualitics.com).

#### What it visualizes:

| Dimension   | Source Field             |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| X-axis      | IP address (source/dest)  |
| Y-axis      | Service or protocol       |
| Z-axis      | CVE ID                    |
| Color       | Exploit description       |

It adapts dynamically to either:
- `pcap_matches.csv` (from `.pcap` input)
- `nmap_matches.csv` (from `.xml` input)

---

## How to Use

1. Make sure Virtualitics Explore is installed and running.
2. Run:

```bash
python tools/pyvip_exploit_scatter.py
```

3. When prompted:
   - Paste your **pyVIP API token** (or set it via `VIP_AUTH_TOKEN` env variable)
   - Enter the full path to a CSV file (e.g. `data/output/pcap_matches.csv`)

4. A 3D visualization session will open in Explore.

## Requirements

Install `pyVIP` via:

```bash
pip install pyVIP
```

Ensure that:
- Virtualitics Explore is running
- API access is enabled (Settings â†’ API â†’ Enable)
- Your token is valid (https://accounts.virtualitics.com)

## Ideas for Expansion

This folder is ideal for:
- Report generation (HTML/PDF summaries)
- Batch comparisons (multiple match files)
- CLI wrappers or lightweight dashboards
- Exploratory data analysis scripts (e.g. `plot_cve_frequency.py`)

## Tip

You can connect the outputs from this script into the Virtualitics AI recommendation engine for auto-clustering, outlier detection, and more â€” no manual 3D plotting needed.
