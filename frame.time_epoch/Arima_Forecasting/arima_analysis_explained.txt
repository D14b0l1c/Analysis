ARIMA Anomaly Detection in PCAP Timing Analysis
===============================================

What is ARIMA?
--------------
ARIMA stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average. It is a statistical model used for time series forecasting and anomaly detection.
In the context of PCAP (packet capture) analysis, ARIMA can be used to model the time intervals (Δt) between network packets and detect unexpected timing patterns.

Use Case in Network Analysis
----------------------------
We calculate the time delta (Δt) between each packet using the 'frame.time_epoch' field from the PCAP. This gives us a time series of packet arrival intervals.
ARIMA is then trained on this Δt sequence to predict what the next interval should be based on past behavior.

How Anomalies Are Detected
--------------------------
1. ARIMA forecasts what the Δt value "should" be at each point.
2. The actual Δt is compared to the predicted value.
3. The difference (called the residual) is calculated: residual = actual - predicted
4. If the residual is unusually large (beyond 3 standard deviations), the packet is flagged as an anomaly.

What the Results Show
---------------------
The plotted results include:
- A line showing actual Δt values (how long between packets)
- A line showing ARIMA's forecasted Δt values
- Red dots indicating where the actual timing deviated significantly from the forecast

These red points can indicate:
- Sudden bursts (very short gaps)
- Network delays (long gaps)
- Malicious or misbehaving traffic patterns
- Beaconing or periodic behavior changes

Benefits
--------
- Works well on sequences with predictable patterns
- Detects both outliers and shifts in traffic behavior
- Non-parametric — doesn’t require prior labeling

Limitations
-----------
- ARIMA assumes linear relationships and stationarity
- May miss very subtle anomalies in noisy data
- Needs careful parameter tuning for best performance

Conclusion
----------
Using ARIMA on packet timing provides a statistical way to detect abnormal traffic timing patterns, potentially revealing scans, DoS activity, or malware communication.
