Sliding Window + One-Class SVM Anomaly Detection in PCAP Timing Analysis
========================================================================

Overview
--------
This method detects anomalous behavior in PCAP traffic using a combination of sliding window feature extraction and One-Class SVM (Support Vector Machine).
It breaks the packet delta time series into windows and analyzes statistical features of each window to identify unusual patterns.

What It Analyzes
----------------
- Extracts packet arrival times from a PCAP using TShark (`frame.time_epoch`)
- Calculates time deltas (Δt) between each packet
- Slides a fixed-size window over the Δt series and computes:
  - Average time gap (mean)
  - Standard deviation (jitter)
  - Packet count in the window
- These features are used as input to One-Class SVM for anomaly detection

How It Works
------------
1. A sliding window moves through the Δt values, generating summary statistics per window.
2. Features are normalized using `StandardScaler`.
3. One-Class SVM is trained to learn the "normal" region in the feature space.
4. Windows that fall outside this learned region are flagged as anomalies.

What the Plot Shows
-------------------
- X-axis: Index of each window
- Y-axis: Anomaly score (1 = normal, -1 = anomaly)
- Shows which windows One-Class SVM considers "unusual"

Interpretation Examples
-----------------------
- Sudden changes in average Δt or jitter will appear as spikes
- Bursts, silences, or timing irregularities grouped within a window can trigger anomalies
- This is helpful when patterns are consistent over small segments of time but not globally

Benefits
--------
- Captures short-term deviations in timing behavior
- Adaptable via window size and feature selection
- Works well on semi-structured timing irregularities

Limitations
-----------
- Sensitivity depends on window size and SVM parameters
- May not detect single-packet anomalies
- Requires some parameter tuning for optimal results

Conclusion
----------
Sliding window analysis with One-Class SVM is a flexible technique that provides anomaly detection across time-localized behaviors in network traffic. It balances statistical methods with machine learning and works well in combination with other time-series models.
