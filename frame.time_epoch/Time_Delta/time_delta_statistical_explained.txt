Statistical Threshold-Based Anomaly Detection in PCAP Timing Analysis
======================================================================

Overview
--------
This script uses a simple statistical method to detect anomalies in network traffic by analyzing the time delta (Δt) between packets in a PCAP file.
It identifies values that fall significantly outside the expected timing pattern based on standard deviation from the mean.

What It Analyzes
----------------
- Extracts packet arrival timestamps using TShark (`frame.time_epoch`)
- Calculates Δt = time difference between consecutive packets
- Computes the statistical mean and standard deviation (std) of the Δt values
- Flags Δt values outside the range: [mean - 3*std, mean + 3*std] as anomalies

How It Works
------------
1. Calculate the average (mean) and standard deviation of all Δt values.
2. Compute upper and lower thresholds using the formula:
     - Upper = mean + 3 × std
     - Lower = mean - 3 × std
3. Δt values above the upper or below the lower threshold are considered outliers.
4. These anomalies are visualized in the plot.

What the Plot Shows
-------------------
- X-axis: Packet index (arrival order)
- Y-axis: Δt (time between packets)
- Solid line = Δt values over time
- Red dashed lines = threshold boundaries (mean ± 3σ)
- Red dots = anomalous Δt values outside the normal range

Interpretation Examples
-----------------------
- Very short Δt values may indicate a traffic burst or flood
- Very long Δt values may indicate idle periods or connection stalls
- This method helps flag packet behavior that deviates sharply from the norm

Benefits
--------
- Simple and fast to compute
- No machine learning or training needed
- Effective for catching obvious timing outliers

Limitations
-----------
- Assumes a normal distribution of Δt values
- Cannot detect subtle or structured anomalies (e.g., periodic spikes, jitter)
- Not adaptive to changes in baseline traffic behavior

Conclusion
----------
This threshold-based approach provides a quick and effective baseline for identifying extreme timing anomalies in packet traffic. It works best as a first-pass filter before applying more complex models like ARIMA or Autoencoders.
